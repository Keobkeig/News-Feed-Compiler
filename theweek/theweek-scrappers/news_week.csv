But Chinese carmakers are beginning to fill the gap as part of Beijing’s ambitious automaking expansion abroad.</p>, <p>The Chinese manufacturers’ plans carry especially strong symbolism: BYD plans to set up shop in an abandoned Ford factory, while Great Wall Motors will take over an old Mercedes-Benz factory.</p>, <p>Experts point to a series of benefits for Chinese car companies in Brazil, a middle-income country of 203 million people with a <a href=""/news/2022/12/14/brazil-to-resume-diplomatic-relations-with-venezuela-under-lula"">non-aligned</a> foreign policy.</p>, <p>“There is no geopolitical tension here with China, unlike Europe, the USA or Canada,” Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist and author of Brazil-China Relations in the 21st Century, told Al Jazeera. “There is no vetoing of Chinese companies, the great example being Huawei, which <a href=""/economy/2019/7/15/defying-us-brazil-allows-huawei-to-move-forward-with-5g-network"">operates in Brazil</a> with total freedom.”</p>, <p>He said BYD’s new facilities will act as a jumping-off point to expand in the region.</p>, <p>“They are going to use Brazil as an export platform to other countries in South America, to countries like <a href=""/economy/2023/7/17/argentinas-yuan-lifeline-sign-of-brinksmanship-between-china-us"">Argentina</a> and Chile, which is something that other multinationals also do here,” he added.</p>, <p>Almost half of China’s current investments in South America are in Brazil, which offers opportunities for Chinese manufacturers, said Tulio Cariello, content and research director at the Brazil-China Business Council.</p>, <p>“Brazil is a country that has an emerging middle class,” he told Al Jazeera, “and it is a country where people want to have a car.”</p>, <p>According to Brazil’s Institute of Geography and Statistics, just under 50 percent of the country’s households had a car in 2022, compared with 92 percent in the United States.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_753_component_1257_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_753_component_1263_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

The visit seemed aimed at repairing a relationship previously strained by the <a href=""/news/2020/4/7/china-outraged-over-brazil-coronavirus-comments"">anti-China stance</a> of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>, <p>As part of that renewed rapport, Brazil offered China concessions to attract the car manufacturer.</p>, <p>In return for its commitment to invest, <a href=""/economy/2022/12/5/chinas-byd-says-it-will-start-selling-evs-in-japan-by-early-2023"">BYD</a> will receive a 95-percent break on Brazil’s value-added tax until 2032, no car ownership tax on electric vehicles up to 300,00 reals ($62,375), and access to the nearby Aratu Port for the import of raw materials and exports of the products it makes locally.</p>, <p>Brazilian authorities also promised to improve the roads to reach the port as well as considering withdrawing property taxes, dependent on talks with Camacari city hall, according to Brazil’s UOL news portal’s specialist car column.</p>, <p>While Brazil’s electric vehicle (EV) market is still in its nascent stages, selling just 564 units in the first quarter of 2023, Cariello said that — in the long term — Brazil would catch up with more advanced electric car markets and that the Chinese are “pioneers” to establish themselves first in the local market.</p>, <p>Rodrigo Zeidan, a professor of finance and economics at New York University Shanghai and at Brazil’s Dom Cabral Foundation, said China’s <a href=""/news/2023/6/5/visualising-the-growth-of-the-electric-car-industry"">electric models</a> were more suited to the budgets of middle-income countries like Brazil.</p>, <p>“The Western companies are building more valuable models like Tesla.

In just seven days in July,  BYD received 44,000 job applications for its announced 5,000 vacancies.</p>, <p>Zeidan warned that current infrastructure to support electric vehicles in Brazil is woefully inadequate and building charging stations for cars across the vast country “requires long-term planning”.</p>, <p>Chinese companies, often helped by generous <a href=""/economy/2021/11/5/china-open-to-talks-on-subsidies-behind-us-tensions-xi-says"">state subsidies</a> and loans, are able to work in longer time frames than competitors, which may help them in Brazil, Santoro said.</p>, <p>Still, he and other experts interviewed by Al Jazeera warned of significant challenges ahead, including China’s <a href=""/features/2023/1/24/is-chinas-high-growth-era-over"">slowing economy</a> and geopolitical tensions with other world powers, as limits to the Lula government’s hopes to “reindustrialise” Brazil.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_1475_component_1979_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_1475_component_1985_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Inside the eviction of Palestinians losing their Jerusalem home,The Sub Labans lost their home of several decades after being forced out by Israel at the start of the month.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>The Sub Labans lost their home of several decades after being forced out by Israel at the start of the month. Willem Marx recounts the story of the eviction, and the push to force Palestinians out.</em></p>, <p><strong>Occupied East Jerusalem –</strong> In the darkness, just after 4:30am [01:30 GMT], police officers began to seal off the narrow sloping street, al-Khalidiyya Ascent, named for an illustrious family who had established a nearby public library.</p>, <p>Some of the officers positioned themselves in doorways opposite the designated building, equipped with Kevlar vests and truncheons, others in a row along the top of a stone step.</p>, <p>Despite the dim grey light, the soaring Dome of the Rock inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound was still visible in the near distance, towering over the alleyway and the rooftops.</p>, <p>The police commander’s quiet signal was eventually given less than an hour later. After decades of conflict, debate and courtroom drama leading up to this finale, the speed of the eviction on July 11 was itself extraordinary.</p>, <p>A small team of officers entered through the cornflower blue metal door into the building’s cramped foyer.</p>, <p>They needed just a handful of seconds to break open the white wooden doorway of the Sub Laban family home for the past 70 years.</p>, <p>“It was very, very fast,” said Alma Shibolet, one of a small number of people who had been inside the cramped 60-square-metre (645-square-foot) apartment. “They just push the door, came storming in, like dozens of them, immediately.”</p>, <p>This account is based on testimony and videos from Shibolet and fellow members of the Free Jerusalem group of activists, who use non-violent methods to protest what they consider to be Israeli government discrimination against Palestinians in Jerusalem. Half a dozen of them had barricaded themselves in the house, alongside Mustafa Sub Laban, 72, whose wife Nora Ghaith, had been born there.</p>, <p>The six activists were forcibly ejected – some physically carried out – while the elderly Sub Laban was given just a few minutes to collect his belongings.</p>, <p>Once they were removed, the furniture and the family’s other possessions were simply left inside. The family even says they have been told to expect an invoice to cover the cost of legal proceedings and their subsequent removal.</p>, <p>It was not the first time Palestinians have been forced out of their homes in this manner. It will likely not be the last.</p>, <p>Instead, the events represent just the latest salvo in a continuing citywide battle over housing and homeownership.</p>, <p>But at the heart of it was a single family, and its matriarch, 68-year-old mother of five, Nora.</p>, <p>She was born in a Jerusalem that was markedly different from the city of today.</p>, <p>At the time of her birth, her family had been renting the small stone-walled home in the Old City for about decade – the rental agreement signed in 1953, just a few years after the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel, an event Palestinians describe as the “Nakba”, or catastrophe.</p>, <p>The landlord back then was a Jordanian government authority that maintained control over Jerusalem’s walled Old City according to a 1949 Armistice agreement that concluded the first war between Israel and several Arab states.</p>, <p>By her late teens, much had changed for Nora. On the personal front, with her father already dead years earlier, her mother also passed away, and she was left to look after some of her siblings alone.</p>, <p>“I admit I deprived myself a lot,” she recalled tearfully. “But I did not deprive my own children.”</p>, <p>Politically, too, the situation in Jerusalem had radically shifted following the 1967 war, after which Israel occupied East Jerusalem. Nora began to slowly feel like a stranger in places she had known as a child.</p>, <p>“People in the streets were buying and selling, but they were not speaking our language,” she remembered. “I don’t even speak Hebrew.”</p>, <p>With most of her siblings living overseas by then, and denied legal standing in the ensuing dispute over the property, a legal battle began, seeking to take Nora’s home from her, even as she and her husband Mustafa set down their own roots and started to raise children there.</p>, <p>Initially, it was an Israeli government entity that acted as a hostile landlord, seeking to force the growing Palestinian family from their home.</p>, <p>But later, an organisation called the Galetzia Trust continued to pursue their eviction through years of persistent court action.</p>, <p>The Trust asserted that, prior to 1948, the home’s owners had been Jewish. The Sub Laban family does not dispute that. But they point out that the Trust is not a family descendant of those original owners, so its control over the building is not rooted in a defensible historical claim, but is, in fact, a product of Israel’s current military-backed occupation of the Old City.</p>, <p>The contest over residency in the Sub Laban’s building has become, to some extent, a harbinger of the future of Palestinians in the Old City; reflecting the wider conflict over land and living that is playing out across the occupied West Bank.</p>, <p>The fate of Nora’s childhood home, where – until this month – she slept in the same bed her own mother had passed away in, is just one battle in the politicised real estate contest that is roiling the holy city under Israel’s current government, with hard-right political parties exerting unprecedented influence on the state’s behaviour.</p>, <p>The rise of successive right-wing governments has meant that some of Israel’s most powerful and politically connected settler organisations have felt more supported than ever in their long-running efforts to ensure Israeli Jewish families take over homes across occupied East Jerusalem.</p>, <p>That had already happened to adjacent properties above, beside and below the Sub Laban’s home.</p>, <p>After years of ill health that stemmed from stress, Nora had grown especially “agitated” in the weeks leading up to the eviction, she told Al Jazeera, and began using sedatives multiple times a day. “I’ve taken them morning noon and night because I can feel my heart pounding.”</p>, <p>But the Sub Labans’ experience is symptomatic of that wider issue, said Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, the European Union’s Ambassador to Palestine, a “case of eviction of a family who has housing rights here given to them on the basis of contracts established decades ago”.</p>, <p>They had paid their rent throughout that period and enjoyed protected tenancy status even after the end of the 1967 war, he insisted.</p>, <p>“For me, it’s politically, it’s legally, it’s morally unacceptable,” von Burgsdorff told Al Jazeera in June outside the home, at a time when the police-led eviction was initially expected. “We hope that the Israeli authorities will change their position.”</p>, <p>The Israeli state did not, and within hours of the eventual eviction in July, Israeli flags could be seen flying from the apartment’s windows and rooftop.</p>, <p>Israeli citizen Eli Attal, who acts on behalf of the Galetzia Trust and has been the driving force behind the eviction and many others in the neighbourhood over recent years, was crowded by protesters as he arrived at the doorway, shouting defiantly at those opposed to his efforts.</p>, <p>Entering alongside him were several young men in traditional Jewish garb, who were soon visible from the same upstairs windows where Nora had looked out on the street below for her entire life.</p>, <p>Outside, much younger boys from observant Jewish families who lived in the building next door held up their own signs in support of the move.</p>, <p>Reached by phone last week, Attal responded in a WhatsApp message in Hebrew, “I don’t talk to journalists,” before insisting he was not excited by the eviction, but was merely “doing what’s right”.</p>, <p>In 1973, Israel enacted a law that allowed anybody who could show a connection with a property’s pre-1948 owner, if they were Jewish, to assert their rights to it, explained Muhammad Dahleh, the Sub Laban family’s lawyer.</p>, <p>He said it is this legislation that has helped Attal and other Israeli organisations he works with to take control over many similar homes in the Old City.</p>, <p>“It’s outrageous that Israel, even today in 2023, is using this discriminatory law against Palestinians, only to evict Palestinians from houses and homes in East Jerusalem,” Dahleh told Al Jazeera.</p>, <p>He said the Sub Laban eviction was “based on a legislation that Israel enacted purposefully for this matter, to be able to evict Palestinians from their houses in East Jerusalem”.</p>, <p>Palestinians are not permitted to assert equivalent ownership rights over homes in Israel that were owned by their forebears prior to 1948.</p>, <p>Several hours after the eviction, activists and more family members, including a distraught Nora had gathered outside the building.</p>, <p>Dozens of police had also gathered. Her sons Luay, Ahmad and Rafat remained close to her in support.</p>, <p>Rafat, a human rights officer at the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, sometimes used a megaphone to lead chants among the group as they walked along the historic via Dolorosa, part of the route Jesus Christ is believed by Christians to have made through the city before his crucifixion.</p>, <p>Today, that maze of ancient alleys lies in a neighbourhood that was codified by the British in the early 20th century as the Muslim Quarter.</p>, <p>Rafat’s chants focused on both the eviction and Israel’s continued occupation of East Jerusalem.</p>, <p>At a nearby spot where an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man, 32-year-old Eyad al-Hallaq, had been shot and killed in 2020, the group shouted, “Justice for Nora, Justice for Eyad.”</p>, <p>Just days earlier, an unnamed Israeli policeman charged with the “involuntary reckless manslaughter” of al-Hallaq <a href=""/news/2023/7/6/israeli-court-acquits-officer-of-killing-autistic-palestinian-man"">had been acquitted</a> by an Israeli court.</p>, <p>One man sporting a New York Yankees baseball cap, a Free Jerusalem activist who had been forced out of the Sub Laban’s home by police earlier in the morning, carried a sign that read “This is Ethnic Cleansing”.</p>, <p>On at least two occasions, videos taken by activists showed the same man being violently pushed or carried away from locations in Jerusalem’s Old City by Israeli police personnel.</p>, <p>Back at the building later that night some of the same activists – “anti-occupation fairies”, as Rafat Sub Laban terms them – had daubed ‘FREE’ on the outside wall, and ‘Free Nora’ on the door itself. Scrawled in blue and black pen on cardboard and placed about the doorway earlier had been another sign, too, reading “Here Live the Thieves”.</p>, <p>Nora herself seemed to agree with that description, at least in a metaphorical sense, during an interview inside the home before the forced eviction. “They are stealing the past,” she said, her eyes often damp with tears. “Through the past, you live your present and your future. When they do that, you’ll have no past and no future.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_526_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_532_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Russia’s defence ministry claimed that thousands of tonnes of fuel oil had been destroyed as well.</p>, <p>“According to experts, it will take at least a year to fully restore the objects that were damaged,” said Ukraine’s agriculture ministry, predicting a global food crisis similar to that in the first five months of the war.</p>, <p>“If we cannot export food, the population of the poorest countries will be on the verge of survival,” said Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi.</p>, <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned Russia’s actions, saying that the “EU is working to ensure food security for the world’s vulnerable” by using rail and barge transport.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_526_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_532_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Ukrainian troops appeared to be pinned down in the northern manoeuvre on July 16. However, two days later, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said they had again advanced to capture almost all the dominant heights above the city.</p>, <p>After months of going head-to-head with Ukraine in Bakhmut, Russia succeeded in launching a new offensive in the east. On July 14, it began an advance towards Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, trying to push Ukrainian forces to the west bank of the Oskil river – a position Russia had held until September.</p>, <p>“We are on the defensive,” Hanna Maliar wrote on Telegram. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces were holding their lines of defence.</p>, <p>On July 18, Maliar said Ukrainian troops had retaken the initiative and suggested a logic for Russia’s Kupiansk offensive.</p>, <p>“This is happening in response to our offensive in Bakhmut … in order to stretch our forces so that we cannot concentrate on the area where we are attacking,” Maliar said in a telethon.</p>, <p>Russia’s defence ministry claimed that Russian forces had advanced up to 2km along the front and up to 1.5km in depth in Kupiansk.</p>, <p>The New York Times reported <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/ukraine-leopards-bradleys-counteroffensive.html"" target=""_blank"">a change in Ukrainian tactics</a> that partly explained the counteroffensive’s slow progress.</p>, <p>Ukrainian forces were focused on wearing down Russian defenders with artillery and long-range missiles instead of large-scale assaults, in an effort to conserve manpower and equipment, it reported.</p>, <p>The change came after Russia reportedly destroyed a <a href=""/news/2023/7/5/steady-deliberate-ukrainian-advance-meets-russian-resistance"">fifth of Ukraine’s Western military kit</a> in the opening two weeks of the counteroffensive, and led to the loss of just 10 percent of the kit in the weeks since.</p>, <p>Despite its stout defence, Russia appeared to suffer from insubordination from top commanders.</p>, <p>A colleague of Major General Ivan Popov’s made his address to his troops public after he was dismissed from the command of the 58th CAA.</p>, <p>Popov had complained about shortcomings on the front facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive south of Orikhiv, in western Zaporizhia, directly to Russia’s Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.</p>, <p>Russian military reporters said he complained that his troops needed to be rotated because they had been serving on the front lines since October. But Popov revealed other weaknesses as well, in a translation of his remarks by independent news outlet Meduza.</p>, <p>“I didn’t sugarcoat it. I pinpointed the main tragedy of today’s warfare: the lack of counterbattery fire, the lack of artillery reconnaissance stations, and the mass death and mutilation of all our brothers by enemy artillery,” Popov was reported as having said, suggesting that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was taking a serious toll on Russian troops.</p>, <p>A series of senior commander dismissals led to speculation among Russian sources on July 15 that the Russian defence ministry may be preparing to arrest Airborne Forces (VDV) Commander Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky.</p>, <p>Russian military reporters posted an audio excerpt the following day, purporting to be elements of the 7th VDV Division threatening to withdraw from their positions in occupied Kherson if the Russian defence establishment arrested Teplinsky.</p>, <p>The dismissal of Popov and speculation over Teplinsky came after the Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin mutinied against the defence ministry command last month.</p>, <p>“Popov’s… Teplinsky’s and… Prigozhin’s challenges to [Chief of Staff Valery] Gerasimov’s and [defence minister Sergei] Shoigu’s authority have established a precedent for insubordination that can hollow out support for the Russian military command among senior officers,” said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.</p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/33K64R7-highres-1689832516.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'A Ukrainian soldier of the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade fires a 40mm grenade launcher at the front line near the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region [Anatolii Stepanov/AFP]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-17T084645Z_2052465306_RC2W42AWM3JY_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-CRIMEA-BRIDGE-1689612162.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C433&quality=80', 'Russian investigators and emergency services members gather near a destroyed car on a damaged section of road following an alleged attack on the Kerch bridge, in this still image taken from video released on July 17, 2023 [Handout/Investigative Committee of Russia via Reuters]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/33P7769-highres-1689496245.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'A Ukrainian artilleryman poses as he holds a position at the front line near the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region, on July 15, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine [Anatolii Stepanov / AFP]']]","[['https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.581.0_en.html#goog_4690525', 'Russia warns Ukraine-bound ships on Black Sea from Thursday']]",Russia-Ukraine war,2023-07-20,2023-07-20
Why organisers think ‘sky is the limit’ for new US cricket league,"Major League Cricket’s co-founder talks to Al Jazeera about the new venture, the US market and the spread of the sport.","[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Major League Cricket’s co-founder talks to Al Jazeera about the new venture, the US market and the spread of the sport in the US.</em></p>, <p>A sell-out crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas last week witnessed <a href=""/sports/2023/7/14/unbelievable-atmosphere-major-league-cricket-takes-off-in-us"">the opening match</a> of cricket’s latest T20 league, the Major League Cricket (MLC) that is taking place in the United States.</p>, <p>So far, the 200-mark has been crossed twice, a side has been bowled out for 50 and the temperature has crossed the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) barrier amid a heatwave that hit the US state.</p>, <p>The MLC, founded in 2019 but launched in 2023, kicked off 16 years after the inaugural T20 World Cup and 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is now the world’s biggest domestic T20 cricket league.</p>, <p>As the MLC moves from Texas to North Carolina, MLC’s co-founder Sameer Mehta spoke to Al Jazeera on how the league <a href=""/sports/2023/3/14/qa-mlc-director-on-the-new-cricket-league-in-the-usa"">plans to stand out among the crowd</a>, break into the sport-heavy US market and if cricket can win American hearts.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: MLC is not the first T20 league and definitely won’t be the last. How do you plan on making it stand out in the crowd?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Sameer Mehta</strong>: From my time running Willow TV [an online subscription-based viewing service], we realised that the US is a very, very viable market for cricket. There’s a strong audience here, especially the eight million expats. Now we have immense hunger from probably the best investors in the world, we’re building our own stadiums, we’ll be playing in the summer when there’s not much cricket going on and we have the second largest salary cap in the world alongside a few other leagues.</p>, <p>What we really have are the 400 million people in the US that are going to discover the sport at some point. They will fall in love with the sport. For every fan we have, if we can get one more mainstream fan to be a fan of cricket, we will be the second or third biggest market in the world. That’s the ambition.</p>, <p>It’s not just to run a T20 league, there are plenty of those around the world, but to be up there and the mainstream Americans to follow the sport.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: Mainstream Americans have plenty on their hands right now with NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS and golf, among others. How confident are you that they will take up cricket?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> It will take time. The Indians and the Pakistanis will be the first fans. It’s our first season. We’ve just launched. We want to make sure we get the product right this year. Our absolute goal is that next year, when we have a full season, we want to market very heavily to the mainstream American fans and make them fall in love with the sport.</p>, <p>This country is a country of franchise sport. Every sports fan here is used to following three, four, five franchise teams. Even in football, all the top teams are franchises. Cricket should be no different.</p>, <p>We don’t want to compete with them [MLB, NBA]. We want to thrive off them. Americans are obsessed about sport. When they follow a sport, they follow it grandly. In this country, where the economics, the revenue, the way sport is handled, the way broadcast rights are handled, the way players are treated, it is just mind-boggling. If we have a slice of it, I’m more than happy. I don’t need to compete with football or basketball. We have a beautiful bat-and-ball game and the T20 version is perfect for the US audience. The sky is the limit out here.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: T20 cricket has been around for a while. Why has it taken a long time for a league to be launched in this market?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> I feel like things happen at the right time. Our view was when T20 took off and built roots, it matured to a point where it has become a world-class product.</p>, <p>We decided to launch the league in 2017-18. It took a little bit of time to make sure the ICC and everyone else was fully on board. We also did not want to play in makeshift stadiums. We said if we’re going to do it, we’ll do it properly. I don’t think it’s been that long, there’s no urgency to it. The sport has matured, it took T20 a decade to find its feet and now it is the dominant version of cricket in the world. T20 is where the world is shifting to and as far as the US is concerned, it’s the absolute right sport for the market.</p>, <p>Americans like to root for a team in the place they live in. American sport is hyper-local and that’s what you want to bring to franchise cricket.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: MLC is now being seen as a product to help promote the sport in the US. How do you feel about that and what role should the governing body play?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> As I said earlier, this country is one of franchise sport. If you want to come to the US, you have to play franchise sport, otherwise the sport can go elsewhere. Here, the only way to do it is via private capital and private stadiums. The governing bodies should do what they do and should absolutely try and collaborate with us … on usage of facilities and so on for the national teams. Franchises do things differently and are willing to invest and that’s how franchise sport is so popular. Governing bodies have smaller budgets and that’s not how a sport grows in the US. Frankly, both sides need each other.</p>, <p>In India, Pakistan and all those countries, the governing bodies have been around for a long time and receive massive budgets. For a new country like the US, where will they get any government assistance? It won’t happen. Private capital has to do it.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: What’s next for the MLC then? What will it look like post season 1?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> We’re moving very, very fast. Next year will be a full season. Right now, we’re playing at two venues. We’re hoping to expand that to four next year which is also the Cricket World Cup year in the US. That’ll bring a lot of attention to the sport and the league. Hopefully we’ll be able to share venues with the World Cup organisers and vice versa.</p>, <p>The plan is for each team to have a permanent home venue by 2025 or 2026. We feel pretty confident that by 2026, each team will be applying home and away. You have got to have local fans. Once we become the top three to four financial nations in the world in terms of cricket, the cricketers will follow… and the sport will grow to a point where five to seven years from now, we can be at the top.</p>, <p><em><strong>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</strong></em></p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AJM_MLC08_7427-1689765239.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'The MLC has so far witnessed high turnouts at the matches held at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Andy Mead/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AJM_MLC01_0631-1689765203.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Texas Super Kings fans celebrate a boundary during match one of Major League Cricket season 1 [Andy Mead/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230713_RH7D2232-1689765178.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C1155&quality=80', 'Acrobatic display ahead of the opening match of the MLC at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Richard Huggard/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RON_2251-1689765163.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'The Texas Super Kings versus the Los Angeles Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Ron Gaunt/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]']]",[],Cricket,2023-07-20,2023-07-20
Where is China’s foreign minister Qin Gang?,Qin’s absence from public view has prompted rampant speculation and highlighted Beijing’s lack of transparency.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Qin’s absence from public view has prompted rampant speculation and highlighted Beijing’s lack of transparency.</em></p>, <p>China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang has been absent from public view for more than three weeks despite a diplomatic calendar in Beijing packed with high-profile meetings.</p>, <p>Qin’s prolonged absence has promoted a flurry of speculation about his whereabouts and focused a spotlight on the opaque nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership at the helm of the world’s second-largest economy.</p>, <p>Qin has not been seen in public since June 25, when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.</p>, <p>Qin’s final appearance in state media was a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko, who visited Beijing less than 48 hours after the Wagner mercenary group’s abortive rebellion against Moscow.</p>, <p>Since then, Qin, <a href=""/news/2022/12/30/china-names-us-ambassador-qin-gang-as-new-foreign-minister"">who was named foreign minister in December</a>, has been conspicuously absent from high-profile diplomatic engagements in Beijing.</p>, <p>Qin had been scheduled to meet European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on July 4, but EU officials announced that China cancelled the talks without explanation with only a few days’ warning.</p>, <p>Qin then failed to attend closely-watched meetings with United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US climate envoy John Kerry.</p>, <p>During a meeting of foreign ministers at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Jakarta last week, China was represented by top diplomat Wang Yi, who previously served in Qin’s role and outranks the foreign minister in the CCP pecking order.</p>, <p>China’s foreign ministry at the time said Qin’s absence was due to “health reasons” but omitted that explanation from official transcripts. Chinese officials have since dodged questions about Qin’s health or his whereabouts.</p>, <p>The lack of transparency has sparked a flurry of speculation both in and outside of China, including as yet unsubstantiated rumours that Qin has fallen out of favour with the leadership.</p>, <p>Qin remains listed as foreign minister on the Chinese foreign ministry’s official website.</p>, <p>Qin, a career diplomat, has been long regarded as a close confidant of Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as a rising star within the CCP, who exemplified Beijing’s turn towards aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy in recent years.</p>, <p>The 57-year-old Tianjin native has served in the Chinese government since the late 1980s, mostly in roles related to foreign affairs.</p>, <p>Before his appointment as China’s foreign minister, Qin served in a variety of roles related to diplomacy, including vice minister for foreign affairs, chief spokesman for foreign affairs and several postings at the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom.</p>, <p>Qin also served as head of the protocol department from 2014-2017, putting him in charge of organising Xi’s overseas travel and in close proximity to the Chinese leader.</p>, <p>Most recently, Qin served an 11-month stint as ambassador to the US, where his appointment was widely interpreted as a sign of Xi doubling down on “wolf warrior” diplomacy.</p>, <p>Qin has rejected the characterisation of Xi’s China using “wolf warrior” diplomacy while arguing that Chinese diplomats have no choice but to defend their country if faced with “jackals or wolves”.</p>, <p>It is not usual for high-profile figures in China to go missing for prolonged periods without explanation, although, in recent years, the trend has more commonly involved prominent business people and celebrities than politicians.</p>, <p>Alibaba founder Jack Ma, actress Fan Bingbing and Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai are among a host of prominent figures who have dropped out of public view for a time in recent years.</p>, <p>In some cases, prominent figures have reemerged months or even years later to be accused of crimes.</p>, <p>China’s justice system has a conviction rate close to 100 percent, and officials routinely deny suspects access to legal representation or contact with the outside world for lengthy periods.</p>, <p>China did not confirm the whereabouts of Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese-Canadian billionaire who managed the finances of the families of senior CCP officials, for more than three years after mainland Chinese agents took him from a luxury Hong Kong hotel in 2017.</p>, <p>In 2022, a Shanghai court sentenced Xiao to 13 years in prison for bribery and other corruption-related crimes.</p>, <p>Meng Hongwei, the then-head of Interpol, went missing for several weeks in 2018 after being arrested in China. Meng was sentenced in 2020 by a Chinese court to 13 and a half years in prison for bribery.</p>, <p>In February, Bao Fan, a well-known billionaire investment banker, went missing for two weeks. His company later confirmed Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” without elaborating further.</p>, <p>Senior CCP officials have dropped off the map, too.</p>, <p>Xi himself disappeared from public view for two weeks in 2012 ahead of the CCP’s once-a-decade leadership transition, prompting speculation that the then-vice president had fallen out of favour.</p>, <p>In one of the most spectacular falls from grace from the CCP’s inner circle in recent memory, Bo Xilai, the former communist party secretary of Chongqing, vanished from public view for several months in 2013 before being handed a life sentence for corruption, after his <a href=""/news/2012/7/27/bo-xilais-wife-charged-with-murder"">wife was convicted</a> for the murder of a British businessman.</p>, <p>In 2015, Zhou Yongkang, the former head of China’s security services, became the most senior CCP official yet to be purged after he was sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges.</p>, <p>Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London, said the circumstances of Qin’s absence suggest he has fallen out of favour with Beijing.</p>, <p>“It is not exceptional for senior officials to disappear in China, but apart from Xi Jinping who disappeared himself for nearly two weeks or so in the run-up to the 18th Party Congress, others were disappeared.

"In India, fantasy gaming is causing addiction and financial ruin",Lack of regulation and massive advertising campaigns by fantasy gaming apps have raised addiction concerns.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Lack of regulation and massive advertising campaigns by fantasy gaming apps have raised addiction concerns.</em></p>, <p>Within a month of using betting apps, job seeker Santosh Kol lost the entire 40,000 rupees ($489) his father sent him for his tuition.</p>, <p>Kol’s father, a construction labourer in Sidhi district in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, had borrowed the money from the community leaders in his village to pay for the coaching classes where his son was enrolled to prepare for national competitive exams for government jobs. Kol, 25, said that one of his friends suggested he bet on these apps, which offer the opportunity to earn large sums of money. Initially, he won a few thousand rupees but then became greedy and lost everything.</p>, <p>Kol’s name has been changed to protect his identity.</p>, <p>Kol, who lives in a one-room apartment with books scattered everywhere and a small kitchen in one corner, told Al Jazeera that he was hoping to win money from his betting and return it to the village elders.</p>, <p>He said, “My family is extremely poor. They somehow managed to gather this much money for my fees. I thought I would win money in this app and return his money. However, when I invested my money in these apps, I lost it. Now, I am getting suicidal thoughts” because he is worried about how he will return the money, he said.</p>, <p>Kol is not the only one who is addicted to these apps.</p>, <p>Prateek Kumar, a 16-year-old teen from the same area and an ardent cricket fan has developed a habit of betting on fantasy gaming apps.</p>, <p>His father Lalji Dwivedi is a small farmer and earns about 6,000 to 7,000 rupees ($73 to $85) a month. He told Al Jazeera that his son is hooked on cricket and watches all the matches of the Indian Premier League (IPL), cricket’s most lucrative domestic tournament and which counts some of these gaming apps as its sponsors. Dwivedi blames the ads for luring his son into the gaming world.</p>, <p>“He got influenced by an advertisement during the breaks, and he started using fantasy gaming apps to bet every day,” Dwivedi said. “Now, before each match, he asks me to give him money to bet on these apps. When I refuse to give him money, he gets upset.”</p>, <p>In recent years, fantasy gaming apps have exploded in popularity in India, with millions of users joining platforms such as Dream11, My11Circle and MPL, among others. These apps offer users the chance to create virtual teams of real-life athletes and compete against others based on the performance of these athletes, with the chance to win cash prizes or other rewards.</p>, <p>However, the lack of regulatory authority and the massive advertising campaigns by these platforms have led to concerns about the addictive nature of these apps and the potential harm they can cause to users, particularly children and vulnerable individuals.</p>, <p>Prateek’s favourite apps are Dream11 and My11Circle, his father said. They require a user to be 18 years old to be able to play, but that hasn’t deterred Prateek who used his father’s ID to sign up on both apps.</p>, <p>Al Jazeera’s emails to Dream11, My11Circle and the industry body the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports, went unanswered.</p>, <p>Dwivedi told Al Jazeera that initially, Prateek used to bet between 50 to 100 rupees ($0.60  to $1.20). However, now he creates two to three teams and ends up losing an average of 300 to 400 rupees ($3.70 to $4.90) – money from the family’s savings and from his mother’s earnings as an agricultural labourer – on most days.</p>, <p>“I don’t earn enough money to feed my family. If my son keeps losing this much money, I don’t know how we will manage to survive,” said Dwivedi, adding that he has tried to deny his son the money but as the teen gets agitated, he gives in to his demands.</p>, <p>He added, “I am deeply concerned about my son’s behaviour, which has left me feeling anxious and helpless.”</p>, <p>Fantasy gaming apps were the top advertisers on television during IPL-16, which ended in late May, with 18 percent of the advertising share, up from 15 percent in the previous IPL, according to a TAM advertising report.</p>, <p>The apps use famous cricket players including Saurav Ganguly, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya, as well popular actors like Aamir Khan, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and others to endorse them.</p>, <p>As per a report by consultancy RedSeer, the income of fantasy gaming platforms increased by 24 percent during the IPL cricket matches from 2022 to 2023, reaching over 28 billion rupees ($341m). Around 61 million users took part in fantasy gaming activities, nearly 65 percent of who came from small towns.</p>, <p>These gaming apps require an entry fee to participate, and there is a risk of losing money if the team underperforms. Dream11, the largest fantasy sports platform in India, boasts over 180 million users. MPL claims to have 90 million users, and My11Circle claims to have 40 million users.</p>, <p>Shashank Tiwari, a lawyer at Jabalpur High Court, said that in India, the law for controlling fantasy gaming apps is mainly based on the Public Gambling Act of 1867. This law forbids all types of gambling in the country, except for certain games that involve skill, including bridge and chess. He added that ads for these apps can be misleading because they show people winning a lot of money, but in reality, most players only win a small amount.</p>, <p>Nikkhhil Jethwa, a technology expert and a lawyer, said that if we consider a game as a game of skill, then we must comprehend that the app algorithm controls the entire game, which is synchronised in such a way that the company generates more profit than the players. If a game is classified as a skill game, it should include analytics, statistics, or data studies. Assumption-based decisions cannot be considered skilful.</p>, <p>In India, games requiring a substantial amount of skill can be played for money without being classified as gambling. However, the absence of a standardised set of laws across all states has resulted in difficulties in regulating fantasy gaming apps in the country. For now, certain states have legalised and regulated online gaming, whereas a handful of others have completely prohibited it.</p>, <p>Last year in January, Madhya Pradesh – Santosh Kol and Prateek Kumar’s home state – said it would bring in a new law to regulate online gaming. Home Affairs Minister Narottam Mishra made the announcement after an 11-year-old boy died allegedly by suicide. The boy, according to local media reports, was addicted to online gaming apps and had spent 6,000 rupees ($73) on them without his parents’ knowledge. In December, the state set up a task force to study the technical, legal and other aspects of banning online gambling. It is yet to submit its report.</p>, <p>While Indian law has some provisions – such as the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015, to protect, care for and help rehabilitate children who need it, and the Information Technology Rules of 2021, which require intermediaries to make sure that minors are kept safe from harmful content – these laws are “insufficient in effectively addressing the extensive psychological repercussions, especially the detrimental effects on minors”, lawyer Tiwari said. Instead of piecemeal measures, “a uniform national law to regulate these apps could help to create clarity and consistency in the legal landscape”, he added.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 2014, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences  (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru, India, started the Service for Healthy Use of Technology, or SHUT Clinic. It is India’s first clinic that deals exclusively with mental health problems related to technology use. At the time, the clinic used to get about three to four patients with gaming addictions per week. That number has now shot up to about 20 to 22 individuals seeking help per week, Dr Manoj Sharma, professor of clinical psychology and head of the SHUT Clinic, told Al Jazeera.</p>, <p>According to Dr Sharma, some students are treating these apps as the equivalent of their education, which, he said, is “a worrying trend”. They believe that if they continue to use these apps, they will earn a significant amount of money and recover their losses. This kind of thinking can lead to addiction to these gaming apps, he said.</p>, <p>Most addicted individuals do not acknowledge that they have developed an obsession with these apps, he added. Many parents bring their children to the clinic for treatment, but it takes a considerable amount of time for the children to admit that they are addicted to such apps.</p>, <p>According to Jethwa, fantasy games should not involve money. Instead, the winner should be awarded points so that only individuals with a genuine interest in gaming will participate.</p>, <p>Dr Sharma suggested that instead of focusing on imposing stricter laws, it is crucial to establish forums in smaller cities to create public health awareness about the mental health issues caused by these apps.</p>, <p>The Indian government declared on July 11 that it will impose a <a href=""/economy/2023/7/11/india-hits-online-gaming-with-28-tax"">28 percent tax</a> on online gaming, which analysts expect will be collected from customers who will now have to pay higher fees.</p>, <p>Anirudh Tagat, a research author at the Department of Economics at Monk Prayogshala, a nonprofit research organisation, said the government is treating online games similar to cigarettes and alcohol, hoping that the high taxes will make people not want to play them.</p>, <p>Tagat said, “The government wants to make it more expensive to play these games so that people will stop playing them. But I don’t think people will actually stop playing just because of the high taxes.”</p>, <p>He added, “These apps use different strategies to get people to play and spend money on them. Even if they have to pay a lot of taxes, these apps will still continue to be popular in the long run.”</p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-15T142538Z_1550427713_RC27HW9CP3MB_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-TAX-GAMING-1689826329.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Fantasy gaming apps were the top advertisers on television during the Indian Premier League [File: Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230508162833_IMG_3270-1689825320.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Fantasy gaming apps have exploded in popularity in India in recent years [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230508163426_IMG_3275-1-1689825792.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Santosh Kol planning his fantasy team as he bets money [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Prateek-Kumar-with-his-father-1689826044-e1689826388135.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C554&quality=80', 'Lalji Dwivedi (left) is worried that his son Prateek Kumar (right) is addicted to these gaming apps [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]']]",[],Business and Economy,2023-07-20,2023-07-20
