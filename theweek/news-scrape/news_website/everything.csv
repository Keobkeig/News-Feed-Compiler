But Chinese carmakers are beginning to fill the gap as part of Beijing’s ambitious automaking expansion abroad.</p>, <p>The Chinese manufacturers’ plans carry especially strong symbolism: BYD plans to set up shop in an abandoned Ford factory, while Great Wall Motors will take over an old Mercedes-Benz factory.</p>, <p>Experts point to a series of benefits for Chinese car companies in Brazil, a middle-income country of 203 million people with a <a href=""/news/2022/12/14/brazil-to-resume-diplomatic-relations-with-venezuela-under-lula"">non-aligned</a> foreign policy.</p>, <p>“There is no geopolitical tension here with China, unlike Europe, the USA or Canada,” Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist and author of Brazil-China Relations in the 21st Century, told Al Jazeera. “There is no vetoing of Chinese companies, the great example being Huawei, which <a href=""/economy/2019/7/15/defying-us-brazil-allows-huawei-to-move-forward-with-5g-network"">operates in Brazil</a> with total freedom.”</p>, <p>He said BYD’s new facilities will act as a jumping-off point to expand in the region.</p>, <p>“They are going to use Brazil as an export platform to other countries in South America, to countries like <a href=""/economy/2023/7/17/argentinas-yuan-lifeline-sign-of-brinksmanship-between-china-us"">Argentina</a> and Chile, which is something that other multinationals also do here,” he added.</p>, <p>Almost half of China’s current investments in South America are in Brazil, which offers opportunities for Chinese manufacturers, said Tulio Cariello, content and research director at the Brazil-China Business Council.</p>, <p>“Brazil is a country that has an emerging middle class,” he told Al Jazeera, “and it is a country where people want to have a car.”</p>, <p>According to Brazil’s Institute of Geography and Statistics, just under 50 percent of the country’s households had a car in 2022, compared with 92 percent in the United States.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_753_component_1257_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_753_component_1263_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

The visit seemed aimed at repairing a relationship previously strained by the <a href=""/news/2020/4/7/china-outraged-over-brazil-coronavirus-comments"">anti-China stance</a> of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.</p>, <p>As part of that renewed rapport, Brazil offered China concessions to attract the car manufacturer.</p>, <p>In return for its commitment to invest, <a href=""/economy/2022/12/5/chinas-byd-says-it-will-start-selling-evs-in-japan-by-early-2023"">BYD</a> will receive a 95-percent break on Brazil’s value-added tax until 2032, no car ownership tax on electric vehicles up to 300,00 reals ($62,375), and access to the nearby Aratu Port for the import of raw materials and exports of the products it makes locally.</p>, <p>Brazilian authorities also promised to improve the roads to reach the port as well as considering withdrawing property taxes, dependent on talks with Camacari city hall, according to Brazil’s UOL news portal’s specialist car column.</p>, <p>While Brazil’s electric vehicle (EV) market is still in its nascent stages, selling just 564 units in the first quarter of 2023, Cariello said that — in the long term — Brazil would catch up with more advanced electric car markets and that the Chinese are “pioneers” to establish themselves first in the local market.</p>, <p>Rodrigo Zeidan, a professor of finance and economics at New York University Shanghai and at Brazil’s Dom Cabral Foundation, said China’s <a href=""/news/2023/6/5/visualising-the-growth-of-the-electric-car-industry"">electric models</a> were more suited to the budgets of middle-income countries like Brazil.</p>, <p>“The Western companies are building more valuable models like Tesla.

In just seven days in July,  BYD received 44,000 job applications for its announced 5,000 vacancies.</p>, <p>Zeidan warned that current infrastructure to support electric vehicles in Brazil is woefully inadequate and building charging stations for cars across the vast country “requires long-term planning”.</p>, <p>Chinese companies, often helped by generous <a href=""/economy/2021/11/5/china-open-to-talks-on-subsidies-behind-us-tensions-xi-says"">state subsidies</a> and loans, are able to work in longer time frames than competitors, which may help them in Brazil, Santoro said.</p>, <p>Still, he and other experts interviewed by Al Jazeera warned of significant challenges ahead, including China’s <a href=""/features/2023/1/24/is-chinas-high-growth-era-over"">slowing economy</a> and geopolitical tensions with other world powers, as limits to the Lula government’s hopes to “reindustrialise” Brazil.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_1475_component_1979_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_1475_component_1985_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Inside the eviction of Palestinians losing their Jerusalem home,The Sub Labans lost their home of several decades after being forced out by Israel at the start of the month.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>The Sub Labans lost their home of several decades after being forced out by Israel at the start of the month. Willem Marx recounts the story of the eviction, and the push to force Palestinians out.</em></p>, <p><strong>Occupied East Jerusalem –</strong> In the darkness, just after 4:30am [01:30 GMT], police officers began to seal off the narrow sloping street, al-Khalidiyya Ascent, named for an illustrious family who had established a nearby public library.</p>, <p>Some of the officers positioned themselves in doorways opposite the designated building, equipped with Kevlar vests and truncheons, others in a row along the top of a stone step.</p>, <p>Despite the dim grey light, the soaring Dome of the Rock inside the al-Aqsa Mosque compound was still visible in the near distance, towering over the alleyway and the rooftops.</p>, <p>The police commander’s quiet signal was eventually given less than an hour later. After decades of conflict, debate and courtroom drama leading up to this finale, the speed of the eviction on July 11 was itself extraordinary.</p>, <p>A small team of officers entered through the cornflower blue metal door into the building’s cramped foyer.</p>, <p>They needed just a handful of seconds to break open the white wooden doorway of the Sub Laban family home for the past 70 years.</p>, <p>“It was very, very fast,” said Alma Shibolet, one of a small number of people who had been inside the cramped 60-square-metre (645-square-foot) apartment. “They just push the door, came storming in, like dozens of them, immediately.”</p>, <p>This account is based on testimony and videos from Shibolet and fellow members of the Free Jerusalem group of activists, who use non-violent methods to protest what they consider to be Israeli government discrimination against Palestinians in Jerusalem. Half a dozen of them had barricaded themselves in the house, alongside Mustafa Sub Laban, 72, whose wife Nora Ghaith, had been born there.</p>, <p>The six activists were forcibly ejected – some physically carried out – while the elderly Sub Laban was given just a few minutes to collect his belongings.</p>, <p>Once they were removed, the furniture and the family’s other possessions were simply left inside. The family even says they have been told to expect an invoice to cover the cost of legal proceedings and their subsequent removal.</p>, <p>It was not the first time Palestinians have been forced out of their homes in this manner. It will likely not be the last.</p>, <p>Instead, the events represent just the latest salvo in a continuing citywide battle over housing and homeownership.</p>, <p>But at the heart of it was a single family, and its matriarch, 68-year-old mother of five, Nora.</p>, <p>She was born in a Jerusalem that was markedly different from the city of today.</p>, <p>At the time of her birth, her family had been renting the small stone-walled home in the Old City for about decade – the rental agreement signed in 1953, just a few years after the 1948 establishment of the state of Israel, an event Palestinians describe as the “Nakba”, or catastrophe.</p>, <p>The landlord back then was a Jordanian government authority that maintained control over Jerusalem’s walled Old City according to a 1949 Armistice agreement that concluded the first war between Israel and several Arab states.</p>, <p>By her late teens, much had changed for Nora. On the personal front, with her father already dead years earlier, her mother also passed away, and she was left to look after some of her siblings alone.</p>, <p>“I admit I deprived myself a lot,” she recalled tearfully. “But I did not deprive my own children.”</p>, <p>Politically, too, the situation in Jerusalem had radically shifted following the 1967 war, after which Israel occupied East Jerusalem. Nora began to slowly feel like a stranger in places she had known as a child.</p>, <p>“People in the streets were buying and selling, but they were not speaking our language,” she remembered. “I don’t even speak Hebrew.”</p>, <p>With most of her siblings living overseas by then, and denied legal standing in the ensuing dispute over the property, a legal battle began, seeking to take Nora’s home from her, even as she and her husband Mustafa set down their own roots and started to raise children there.</p>, <p>Initially, it was an Israeli government entity that acted as a hostile landlord, seeking to force the growing Palestinian family from their home.</p>, <p>But later, an organisation called the Galetzia Trust continued to pursue their eviction through years of persistent court action.</p>, <p>The Trust asserted that, prior to 1948, the home’s owners had been Jewish. The Sub Laban family does not dispute that. But they point out that the Trust is not a family descendant of those original owners, so its control over the building is not rooted in a defensible historical claim, but is, in fact, a product of Israel’s current military-backed occupation of the Old City.</p>, <p>The contest over residency in the Sub Laban’s building has become, to some extent, a harbinger of the future of Palestinians in the Old City; reflecting the wider conflict over land and living that is playing out across the occupied West Bank.</p>, <p>The fate of Nora’s childhood home, where – until this month – she slept in the same bed her own mother had passed away in, is just one battle in the politicised real estate contest that is roiling the holy city under Israel’s current government, with hard-right political parties exerting unprecedented influence on the state’s behaviour.</p>, <p>The rise of successive right-wing governments has meant that some of Israel’s most powerful and politically connected settler organisations have felt more supported than ever in their long-running efforts to ensure Israeli Jewish families take over homes across occupied East Jerusalem.</p>, <p>That had already happened to adjacent properties above, beside and below the Sub Laban’s home.</p>, <p>After years of ill health that stemmed from stress, Nora had grown especially “agitated” in the weeks leading up to the eviction, she told Al Jazeera, and began using sedatives multiple times a day. “I’ve taken them morning noon and night because I can feel my heart pounding.”</p>, <p>But the Sub Labans’ experience is symptomatic of that wider issue, said Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, the European Union’s Ambassador to Palestine, a “case of eviction of a family who has housing rights here given to them on the basis of contracts established decades ago”.</p>, <p>They had paid their rent throughout that period and enjoyed protected tenancy status even after the end of the 1967 war, he insisted.</p>, <p>“For me, it’s politically, it’s legally, it’s morally unacceptable,” von Burgsdorff told Al Jazeera in June outside the home, at a time when the police-led eviction was initially expected. “We hope that the Israeli authorities will change their position.”</p>, <p>The Israeli state did not, and within hours of the eventual eviction in July, Israeli flags could be seen flying from the apartment’s windows and rooftop.</p>, <p>Israeli citizen Eli Attal, who acts on behalf of the Galetzia Trust and has been the driving force behind the eviction and many others in the neighbourhood over recent years, was crowded by protesters as he arrived at the doorway, shouting defiantly at those opposed to his efforts.</p>, <p>Entering alongside him were several young men in traditional Jewish garb, who were soon visible from the same upstairs windows where Nora had looked out on the street below for her entire life.</p>, <p>Outside, much younger boys from observant Jewish families who lived in the building next door held up their own signs in support of the move.</p>, <p>Reached by phone last week, Attal responded in a WhatsApp message in Hebrew, “I don’t talk to journalists,” before insisting he was not excited by the eviction, but was merely “doing what’s right”.</p>, <p>In 1973, Israel enacted a law that allowed anybody who could show a connection with a property’s pre-1948 owner, if they were Jewish, to assert their rights to it, explained Muhammad Dahleh, the Sub Laban family’s lawyer.</p>, <p>He said it is this legislation that has helped Attal and other Israeli organisations he works with to take control over many similar homes in the Old City.</p>, <p>“It’s outrageous that Israel, even today in 2023, is using this discriminatory law against Palestinians, only to evict Palestinians from houses and homes in East Jerusalem,” Dahleh told Al Jazeera.</p>, <p>He said the Sub Laban eviction was “based on a legislation that Israel enacted purposefully for this matter, to be able to evict Palestinians from their houses in East Jerusalem”.</p>, <p>Palestinians are not permitted to assert equivalent ownership rights over homes in Israel that were owned by their forebears prior to 1948.</p>, <p>Several hours after the eviction, activists and more family members, including a distraught Nora had gathered outside the building.</p>, <p>Dozens of police had also gathered. Her sons Luay, Ahmad and Rafat remained close to her in support.</p>, <p>Rafat, a human rights officer at the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, sometimes used a megaphone to lead chants among the group as they walked along the historic via Dolorosa, part of the route Jesus Christ is believed by Christians to have made through the city before his crucifixion.</p>, <p>Today, that maze of ancient alleys lies in a neighbourhood that was codified by the British in the early 20th century as the Muslim Quarter.</p>, <p>Rafat’s chants focused on both the eviction and Israel’s continued occupation of East Jerusalem.</p>, <p>At a nearby spot where an unarmed, autistic Palestinian man, 32-year-old Eyad al-Hallaq, had been shot and killed in 2020, the group shouted, “Justice for Nora, Justice for Eyad.”</p>, <p>Just days earlier, an unnamed Israeli policeman charged with the “involuntary reckless manslaughter” of al-Hallaq <a href=""/news/2023/7/6/israeli-court-acquits-officer-of-killing-autistic-palestinian-man"">had been acquitted</a> by an Israeli court.</p>, <p>One man sporting a New York Yankees baseball cap, a Free Jerusalem activist who had been forced out of the Sub Laban’s home by police earlier in the morning, carried a sign that read “This is Ethnic Cleansing”.</p>, <p>On at least two occasions, videos taken by activists showed the same man being violently pushed or carried away from locations in Jerusalem’s Old City by Israeli police personnel.</p>, <p>Back at the building later that night some of the same activists – “anti-occupation fairies”, as Rafat Sub Laban terms them – had daubed ‘FREE’ on the outside wall, and ‘Free Nora’ on the door itself. Scrawled in blue and black pen on cardboard and placed about the doorway earlier had been another sign, too, reading “Here Live the Thieves”.</p>, <p>Nora herself seemed to agree with that description, at least in a metaphorical sense, during an interview inside the home before the forced eviction. “They are stealing the past,” she said, her eyes often damp with tears. “Through the past, you live your present and your future. When they do that, you’ll have no past and no future.”</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_526_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_532_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Russia’s defence ministry claimed that thousands of tonnes of fuel oil had been destroyed as well.</p>, <p>“According to experts, it will take at least a year to fully restore the objects that were damaged,” said Ukraine’s agriculture ministry, predicting a global food crisis similar to that in the first five months of the war.</p>, <p>“If we cannot export food, the population of the poorest countries will be on the verge of survival,” said Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Mykola Solskyi.</p>, <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned Russia’s actions, saying that the “EU is working to ensure food security for the world’s vulnerable” by using rail and barge transport.</p>, <p> </p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_526_description"">This is a modal window.</p>, <p class=""vjs-modal-dialog-description vjs-control-text"" id=""vjs_video_3_component_532_description"">Beginning of dialog window.

Ukrainian troops appeared to be pinned down in the northern manoeuvre on July 16. However, two days later, deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said they had again advanced to capture almost all the dominant heights above the city.</p>, <p>After months of going head-to-head with Ukraine in Bakhmut, Russia succeeded in launching a new offensive in the east. On July 14, it began an advance towards Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, trying to push Ukrainian forces to the west bank of the Oskil river – a position Russia had held until September.</p>, <p>“We are on the defensive,” Hanna Maliar wrote on Telegram. Ukraine’s general staff said its forces were holding their lines of defence.</p>, <p>On July 18, Maliar said Ukrainian troops had retaken the initiative and suggested a logic for Russia’s Kupiansk offensive.</p>, <p>“This is happening in response to our offensive in Bakhmut … in order to stretch our forces so that we cannot concentrate on the area where we are attacking,” Maliar said in a telethon.</p>, <p>Russia’s defence ministry claimed that Russian forces had advanced up to 2km along the front and up to 1.5km in depth in Kupiansk.</p>, <p>The New York Times reported <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/ukraine-leopards-bradleys-counteroffensive.html"" target=""_blank"">a change in Ukrainian tactics</a> that partly explained the counteroffensive’s slow progress.</p>, <p>Ukrainian forces were focused on wearing down Russian defenders with artillery and long-range missiles instead of large-scale assaults, in an effort to conserve manpower and equipment, it reported.</p>, <p>The change came after Russia reportedly destroyed a <a href=""/news/2023/7/5/steady-deliberate-ukrainian-advance-meets-russian-resistance"">fifth of Ukraine’s Western military kit</a> in the opening two weeks of the counteroffensive, and led to the loss of just 10 percent of the kit in the weeks since.</p>, <p>Despite its stout defence, Russia appeared to suffer from insubordination from top commanders.</p>, <p>A colleague of Major General Ivan Popov’s made his address to his troops public after he was dismissed from the command of the 58th CAA.</p>, <p>Popov had complained about shortcomings on the front facing a Ukrainian counteroffensive south of Orikhiv, in western Zaporizhia, directly to Russia’s Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov.</p>, <p>Russian military reporters said he complained that his troops needed to be rotated because they had been serving on the front lines since October. But Popov revealed other weaknesses as well, in a translation of his remarks by independent news outlet Meduza.</p>, <p>“I didn’t sugarcoat it. I pinpointed the main tragedy of today’s warfare: the lack of counterbattery fire, the lack of artillery reconnaissance stations, and the mass death and mutilation of all our brothers by enemy artillery,” Popov was reported as having said, suggesting that Ukraine’s counteroffensive was taking a serious toll on Russian troops.</p>, <p>A series of senior commander dismissals led to speculation among Russian sources on July 15 that the Russian defence ministry may be preparing to arrest Airborne Forces (VDV) Commander Colonel General Mikhail Teplinsky.</p>, <p>Russian military reporters posted an audio excerpt the following day, purporting to be elements of the 7th VDV Division threatening to withdraw from their positions in occupied Kherson if the Russian defence establishment arrested Teplinsky.</p>, <p>The dismissal of Popov and speculation over Teplinsky came after the Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin mutinied against the defence ministry command last month.</p>, <p>“Popov’s… Teplinsky’s and… Prigozhin’s challenges to [Chief of Staff Valery] Gerasimov’s and [defence minister Sergei] Shoigu’s authority have established a precedent for insubordination that can hollow out support for the Russian military command among senior officers,” said the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.</p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/33K64R7-highres-1689832516.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'A Ukrainian soldier of the 28th Separate Mechanized Brigade fires a 40mm grenade launcher at the front line near the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region [Anatolii Stepanov/AFP]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-17T084645Z_2052465306_RC2W42AWM3JY_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-CRIMEA-BRIDGE-1689612162.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C433&quality=80', 'Russian investigators and emergency services members gather near a destroyed car on a damaged section of road following an alleged attack on the Kerch bridge, in this still image taken from video released on July 17, 2023 [Handout/Investigative Committee of Russia via Reuters]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/33P7769-highres-1689496245.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'A Ukrainian artilleryman poses as he holds a position at the front line near the town of Bakhmut, Donetsk region, on July 15, 2023, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine [Anatolii Stepanov / AFP]']]","[['https://imasdk.googleapis.com/js/core/bridge3.581.0_en.html#goog_4690525', 'Russia warns Ukraine-bound ships on Black Sea from Thursday']]",Russia-Ukraine war,2023-07-20,2023-07-20
Why organisers think ‘sky is the limit’ for new US cricket league,"Major League Cricket’s co-founder talks to Al Jazeera about the new venture, the US market and the spread of the sport.","[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Major League Cricket’s co-founder talks to Al Jazeera about the new venture, the US market and the spread of the sport in the US.</em></p>, <p>A sell-out crowd at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas last week witnessed <a href=""/sports/2023/7/14/unbelievable-atmosphere-major-league-cricket-takes-off-in-us"">the opening match</a> of cricket’s latest T20 league, the Major League Cricket (MLC) that is taking place in the United States.</p>, <p>So far, the 200-mark has been crossed twice, a side has been bowled out for 50 and the temperature has crossed the 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) barrier amid a heatwave that hit the US state.</p>, <p>The MLC, founded in 2019 but launched in 2023, kicked off 16 years after the inaugural T20 World Cup and 15 years after the Indian Premier League (IPL), which is now the world’s biggest domestic T20 cricket league.</p>, <p>As the MLC moves from Texas to North Carolina, MLC’s co-founder Sameer Mehta spoke to Al Jazeera on how the league <a href=""/sports/2023/3/14/qa-mlc-director-on-the-new-cricket-league-in-the-usa"">plans to stand out among the crowd</a>, break into the sport-heavy US market and if cricket can win American hearts.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: MLC is not the first T20 league and definitely won’t be the last. How do you plan on making it stand out in the crowd?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Sameer Mehta</strong>: From my time running Willow TV [an online subscription-based viewing service], we realised that the US is a very, very viable market for cricket. There’s a strong audience here, especially the eight million expats. Now we have immense hunger from probably the best investors in the world, we’re building our own stadiums, we’ll be playing in the summer when there’s not much cricket going on and we have the second largest salary cap in the world alongside a few other leagues.</p>, <p>What we really have are the 400 million people in the US that are going to discover the sport at some point. They will fall in love with the sport. For every fan we have, if we can get one more mainstream fan to be a fan of cricket, we will be the second or third biggest market in the world. That’s the ambition.</p>, <p>It’s not just to run a T20 league, there are plenty of those around the world, but to be up there and the mainstream Americans to follow the sport.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: Mainstream Americans have plenty on their hands right now with NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS and golf, among others. How confident are you that they will take up cricket?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> It will take time. The Indians and the Pakistanis will be the first fans. It’s our first season. We’ve just launched. We want to make sure we get the product right this year. Our absolute goal is that next year, when we have a full season, we want to market very heavily to the mainstream American fans and make them fall in love with the sport.</p>, <p>This country is a country of franchise sport. Every sports fan here is used to following three, four, five franchise teams. Even in football, all the top teams are franchises. Cricket should be no different.</p>, <p>We don’t want to compete with them [MLB, NBA]. We want to thrive off them. Americans are obsessed about sport. When they follow a sport, they follow it grandly. In this country, where the economics, the revenue, the way sport is handled, the way broadcast rights are handled, the way players are treated, it is just mind-boggling. If we have a slice of it, I’m more than happy. I don’t need to compete with football or basketball. We have a beautiful bat-and-ball game and the T20 version is perfect for the US audience. The sky is the limit out here.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: T20 cricket has been around for a while. Why has it taken a long time for a league to be launched in this market?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> I feel like things happen at the right time. Our view was when T20 took off and built roots, it matured to a point where it has become a world-class product.</p>, <p>We decided to launch the league in 2017-18. It took a little bit of time to make sure the ICC and everyone else was fully on board. We also did not want to play in makeshift stadiums. We said if we’re going to do it, we’ll do it properly. I don’t think it’s been that long, there’s no urgency to it. The sport has matured, it took T20 a decade to find its feet and now it is the dominant version of cricket in the world. T20 is where the world is shifting to and as far as the US is concerned, it’s the absolute right sport for the market.</p>, <p>Americans like to root for a team in the place they live in. American sport is hyper-local and that’s what you want to bring to franchise cricket.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: MLC is now being seen as a product to help promote the sport in the US. How do you feel about that and what role should the governing body play?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> As I said earlier, this country is one of franchise sport. If you want to come to the US, you have to play franchise sport, otherwise the sport can go elsewhere. Here, the only way to do it is via private capital and private stadiums. The governing bodies should do what they do and should absolutely try and collaborate with us … on usage of facilities and so on for the national teams. Franchises do things differently and are willing to invest and that’s how franchise sport is so popular. Governing bodies have smaller budgets and that’s not how a sport grows in the US. Frankly, both sides need each other.</p>, <p>In India, Pakistan and all those countries, the governing bodies have been around for a long time and receive massive budgets. For a new country like the US, where will they get any government assistance? It won’t happen. Private capital has to do it.</p>, <p><strong>Al Jazeera: What’s next for the MLC then? What will it look like post season 1?</strong></p>, <p><strong>Mehta:</strong> We’re moving very, very fast. Next year will be a full season. Right now, we’re playing at two venues. We’re hoping to expand that to four next year which is also the Cricket World Cup year in the US. That’ll bring a lot of attention to the sport and the league. Hopefully we’ll be able to share venues with the World Cup organisers and vice versa.</p>, <p>The plan is for each team to have a permanent home venue by 2025 or 2026. We feel pretty confident that by 2026, each team will be applying home and away. You have got to have local fans. Once we become the top three to four financial nations in the world in terms of cricket, the cricketers will follow… and the sport will grow to a point where five to seven years from now, we can be at the top.</p>, <p><em><strong>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</strong></em></p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AJM_MLC08_7427-1689765239.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'The MLC has so far witnessed high turnouts at the matches held at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Andy Mead/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AJM_MLC01_0631-1689765203.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Texas Super Kings fans celebrate a boundary during match one of Major League Cricket season 1 [Andy Mead/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230713_RH7D2232-1689765178.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C1155&quality=80', 'Acrobatic display ahead of the opening match of the MLC at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Richard Huggard/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RON_2251-1689765163.jpeg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'The Texas Super Kings versus the Los Angeles Knight Riders at the Grand Prairie Stadium [Ron Gaunt/ SPORTZPICS for MLC]']]",[],Cricket,2023-07-20,2023-07-20
Where is China’s foreign minister Qin Gang?,Qin’s absence from public view has prompted rampant speculation and highlighted Beijing’s lack of transparency.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Qin’s absence from public view has prompted rampant speculation and highlighted Beijing’s lack of transparency.</em></p>, <p>China’s Foreign Minister Qin Gang has been absent from public view for more than three weeks despite a diplomatic calendar in Beijing packed with high-profile meetings.</p>, <p>Qin’s prolonged absence has promoted a flurry of speculation about his whereabouts and focused a spotlight on the opaque nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership at the helm of the world’s second-largest economy.</p>, <p>Qin has not been seen in public since June 25, when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam and Sri Lanka.</p>, <p>Qin’s final appearance in state media was a meeting with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko, who visited Beijing less than 48 hours after the Wagner mercenary group’s abortive rebellion against Moscow.</p>, <p>Since then, Qin, <a href=""/news/2022/12/30/china-names-us-ambassador-qin-gang-as-new-foreign-minister"">who was named foreign minister in December</a>, has been conspicuously absent from high-profile diplomatic engagements in Beijing.</p>, <p>Qin had been scheduled to meet European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on July 4, but EU officials announced that China cancelled the talks without explanation with only a few days’ warning.</p>, <p>Qin then failed to attend closely-watched meetings with United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and US climate envoy John Kerry.</p>, <p>During a meeting of foreign ministers at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Jakarta last week, China was represented by top diplomat Wang Yi, who previously served in Qin’s role and outranks the foreign minister in the CCP pecking order.</p>, <p>China’s foreign ministry at the time said Qin’s absence was due to “health reasons” but omitted that explanation from official transcripts. Chinese officials have since dodged questions about Qin’s health or his whereabouts.</p>, <p>The lack of transparency has sparked a flurry of speculation both in and outside of China, including as yet unsubstantiated rumours that Qin has fallen out of favour with the leadership.</p>, <p>Qin remains listed as foreign minister on the Chinese foreign ministry’s official website.</p>, <p>Qin, a career diplomat, has been long regarded as a close confidant of Chinese President Xi Jinping as well as a rising star within the CCP, who exemplified Beijing’s turn towards aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy in recent years.</p>, <p>The 57-year-old Tianjin native has served in the Chinese government since the late 1980s, mostly in roles related to foreign affairs.</p>, <p>Before his appointment as China’s foreign minister, Qin served in a variety of roles related to diplomacy, including vice minister for foreign affairs, chief spokesman for foreign affairs and several postings at the Chinese embassy in the United Kingdom.</p>, <p>Qin also served as head of the protocol department from 2014-2017, putting him in charge of organising Xi’s overseas travel and in close proximity to the Chinese leader.</p>, <p>Most recently, Qin served an 11-month stint as ambassador to the US, where his appointment was widely interpreted as a sign of Xi doubling down on “wolf warrior” diplomacy.</p>, <p>Qin has rejected the characterisation of Xi’s China using “wolf warrior” diplomacy while arguing that Chinese diplomats have no choice but to defend their country if faced with “jackals or wolves”.</p>, <p>It is not usual for high-profile figures in China to go missing for prolonged periods without explanation, although, in recent years, the trend has more commonly involved prominent business people and celebrities than politicians.</p>, <p>Alibaba founder Jack Ma, actress Fan Bingbing and Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai are among a host of prominent figures who have dropped out of public view for a time in recent years.</p>, <p>In some cases, prominent figures have reemerged months or even years later to be accused of crimes.</p>, <p>China’s justice system has a conviction rate close to 100 percent, and officials routinely deny suspects access to legal representation or contact with the outside world for lengthy periods.</p>, <p>China did not confirm the whereabouts of Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese-Canadian billionaire who managed the finances of the families of senior CCP officials, for more than three years after mainland Chinese agents took him from a luxury Hong Kong hotel in 2017.</p>, <p>In 2022, a Shanghai court sentenced Xiao to 13 years in prison for bribery and other corruption-related crimes.</p>, <p>Meng Hongwei, the then-head of Interpol, went missing for several weeks in 2018 after being arrested in China. Meng was sentenced in 2020 by a Chinese court to 13 and a half years in prison for bribery.</p>, <p>In February, Bao Fan, a well-known billionaire investment banker, went missing for two weeks. His company later confirmed Bao was “cooperating in an investigation” without elaborating further.</p>, <p>Senior CCP officials have dropped off the map, too.</p>, <p>Xi himself disappeared from public view for two weeks in 2012 ahead of the CCP’s once-a-decade leadership transition, prompting speculation that the then-vice president had fallen out of favour.</p>, <p>In one of the most spectacular falls from grace from the CCP’s inner circle in recent memory, Bo Xilai, the former communist party secretary of Chongqing, vanished from public view for several months in 2013 before being handed a life sentence for corruption, after his <a href=""/news/2012/7/27/bo-xilais-wife-charged-with-murder"">wife was convicted</a> for the murder of a British businessman.</p>, <p>In 2015, Zhou Yongkang, the former head of China’s security services, became the most senior CCP official yet to be purged after he was sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges.</p>, <p>Steve Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute in London, said the circumstances of Qin’s absence suggest he has fallen out of favour with Beijing.</p>, <p>“It is not exceptional for senior officials to disappear in China, but apart from Xi Jinping who disappeared himself for nearly two weeks or so in the run-up to the 18th Party Congress, others were disappeared.

"In India, fantasy gaming is causing addiction and financial ruin",Lack of regulation and massive advertising campaigns by fantasy gaming apps have raised addiction concerns.,"[<p class=""article__subhead css-1wt8oh6""><em>Lack of regulation and massive advertising campaigns by fantasy gaming apps have raised addiction concerns.</em></p>, <p>Within a month of using betting apps, job seeker Santosh Kol lost the entire 40,000 rupees ($489) his father sent him for his tuition.</p>, <p>Kol’s father, a construction labourer in Sidhi district in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, had borrowed the money from the community leaders in his village to pay for the coaching classes where his son was enrolled to prepare for national competitive exams for government jobs. Kol, 25, said that one of his friends suggested he bet on these apps, which offer the opportunity to earn large sums of money. Initially, he won a few thousand rupees but then became greedy and lost everything.</p>, <p>Kol’s name has been changed to protect his identity.</p>, <p>Kol, who lives in a one-room apartment with books scattered everywhere and a small kitchen in one corner, told Al Jazeera that he was hoping to win money from his betting and return it to the village elders.</p>, <p>He said, “My family is extremely poor. They somehow managed to gather this much money for my fees. I thought I would win money in this app and return his money. However, when I invested my money in these apps, I lost it. Now, I am getting suicidal thoughts” because he is worried about how he will return the money, he said.</p>, <p>Kol is not the only one who is addicted to these apps.</p>, <p>Prateek Kumar, a 16-year-old teen from the same area and an ardent cricket fan has developed a habit of betting on fantasy gaming apps.</p>, <p>His father Lalji Dwivedi is a small farmer and earns about 6,000 to 7,000 rupees ($73 to $85) a month. He told Al Jazeera that his son is hooked on cricket and watches all the matches of the Indian Premier League (IPL), cricket’s most lucrative domestic tournament and which counts some of these gaming apps as its sponsors. Dwivedi blames the ads for luring his son into the gaming world.</p>, <p>“He got influenced by an advertisement during the breaks, and he started using fantasy gaming apps to bet every day,” Dwivedi said. “Now, before each match, he asks me to give him money to bet on these apps. When I refuse to give him money, he gets upset.”</p>, <p>In recent years, fantasy gaming apps have exploded in popularity in India, with millions of users joining platforms such as Dream11, My11Circle and MPL, among others. These apps offer users the chance to create virtual teams of real-life athletes and compete against others based on the performance of these athletes, with the chance to win cash prizes or other rewards.</p>, <p>However, the lack of regulatory authority and the massive advertising campaigns by these platforms have led to concerns about the addictive nature of these apps and the potential harm they can cause to users, particularly children and vulnerable individuals.</p>, <p>Prateek’s favourite apps are Dream11 and My11Circle, his father said. They require a user to be 18 years old to be able to play, but that hasn’t deterred Prateek who used his father’s ID to sign up on both apps.</p>, <p>Al Jazeera’s emails to Dream11, My11Circle and the industry body the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports, went unanswered.</p>, <p>Dwivedi told Al Jazeera that initially, Prateek used to bet between 50 to 100 rupees ($0.60  to $1.20). However, now he creates two to three teams and ends up losing an average of 300 to 400 rupees ($3.70 to $4.90) – money from the family’s savings and from his mother’s earnings as an agricultural labourer – on most days.</p>, <p>“I don’t earn enough money to feed my family. If my son keeps losing this much money, I don’t know how we will manage to survive,” said Dwivedi, adding that he has tried to deny his son the money but as the teen gets agitated, he gives in to his demands.</p>, <p>He added, “I am deeply concerned about my son’s behaviour, which has left me feeling anxious and helpless.”</p>, <p>Fantasy gaming apps were the top advertisers on television during IPL-16, which ended in late May, with 18 percent of the advertising share, up from 15 percent in the previous IPL, according to a TAM advertising report.</p>, <p>The apps use famous cricket players including Saurav Ganguly, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya, as well popular actors like Aamir Khan, R Madhavan, Sharman Joshi and others to endorse them.</p>, <p>As per a report by consultancy RedSeer, the income of fantasy gaming platforms increased by 24 percent during the IPL cricket matches from 2022 to 2023, reaching over 28 billion rupees ($341m). Around 61 million users took part in fantasy gaming activities, nearly 65 percent of who came from small towns.</p>, <p>These gaming apps require an entry fee to participate, and there is a risk of losing money if the team underperforms. Dream11, the largest fantasy sports platform in India, boasts over 180 million users. MPL claims to have 90 million users, and My11Circle claims to have 40 million users.</p>, <p>Shashank Tiwari, a lawyer at Jabalpur High Court, said that in India, the law for controlling fantasy gaming apps is mainly based on the Public Gambling Act of 1867. This law forbids all types of gambling in the country, except for certain games that involve skill, including bridge and chess. He added that ads for these apps can be misleading because they show people winning a lot of money, but in reality, most players only win a small amount.</p>, <p>Nikkhhil Jethwa, a technology expert and a lawyer, said that if we consider a game as a game of skill, then we must comprehend that the app algorithm controls the entire game, which is synchronised in such a way that the company generates more profit than the players. If a game is classified as a skill game, it should include analytics, statistics, or data studies. Assumption-based decisions cannot be considered skilful.</p>, <p>In India, games requiring a substantial amount of skill can be played for money without being classified as gambling. However, the absence of a standardised set of laws across all states has resulted in difficulties in regulating fantasy gaming apps in the country. For now, certain states have legalised and regulated online gaming, whereas a handful of others have completely prohibited it.</p>, <p>Last year in January, Madhya Pradesh – Santosh Kol and Prateek Kumar’s home state – said it would bring in a new law to regulate online gaming. Home Affairs Minister Narottam Mishra made the announcement after an 11-year-old boy died allegedly by suicide. The boy, according to local media reports, was addicted to online gaming apps and had spent 6,000 rupees ($73) on them without his parents’ knowledge. In December, the state set up a task force to study the technical, legal and other aspects of banning online gambling. It is yet to submit its report.</p>, <p>While Indian law has some provisions – such as the Juvenile Justice Act of 2015, to protect, care for and help rehabilitate children who need it, and the Information Technology Rules of 2021, which require intermediaries to make sure that minors are kept safe from harmful content – these laws are “insufficient in effectively addressing the extensive psychological repercussions, especially the detrimental effects on minors”, lawyer Tiwari said. Instead of piecemeal measures, “a uniform national law to regulate these apps could help to create clarity and consistency in the legal landscape”, he added.</p>, <p> </p>, <p>In 2014, the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences  (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru, India, started the Service for Healthy Use of Technology, or SHUT Clinic. It is India’s first clinic that deals exclusively with mental health problems related to technology use. At the time, the clinic used to get about three to four patients with gaming addictions per week. That number has now shot up to about 20 to 22 individuals seeking help per week, Dr Manoj Sharma, professor of clinical psychology and head of the SHUT Clinic, told Al Jazeera.</p>, <p>According to Dr Sharma, some students are treating these apps as the equivalent of their education, which, he said, is “a worrying trend”. They believe that if they continue to use these apps, they will earn a significant amount of money and recover their losses. This kind of thinking can lead to addiction to these gaming apps, he said.</p>, <p>Most addicted individuals do not acknowledge that they have developed an obsession with these apps, he added. Many parents bring their children to the clinic for treatment, but it takes a considerable amount of time for the children to admit that they are addicted to such apps.</p>, <p>According to Jethwa, fantasy games should not involve money. Instead, the winner should be awarded points so that only individuals with a genuine interest in gaming will participate.</p>, <p>Dr Sharma suggested that instead of focusing on imposing stricter laws, it is crucial to establish forums in smaller cities to create public health awareness about the mental health issues caused by these apps.</p>, <p>The Indian government declared on July 11 that it will impose a <a href=""/economy/2023/7/11/india-hits-online-gaming-with-28-tax"">28 percent tax</a> on online gaming, which analysts expect will be collected from customers who will now have to pay higher fees.</p>, <p>Anirudh Tagat, a research author at the Department of Economics at Monk Prayogshala, a nonprofit research organisation, said the government is treating online games similar to cigarettes and alcohol, hoping that the high taxes will make people not want to play them.</p>, <p>Tagat said, “The government wants to make it more expensive to play these games so that people will stop playing them. But I don’t think people will actually stop playing just because of the high taxes.”</p>, <p>He added, “These apps use different strategies to get people to play and spend money on them. Even if they have to pay a lot of taxes, these apps will still continue to be popular in the long run.”</p>]","[['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-15T142538Z_1550427713_RC27HW9CP3MB_RTRMADP_3_INDIA-TAX-GAMING-1689826329.jpg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Fantasy gaming apps were the top advertisers on television during the Indian Premier League [File: Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Reuters]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230508162833_IMG_3270-1689825320.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Fantasy gaming apps have exploded in popularity in India in recent years [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20230508163426_IMG_3275-1-1689825792.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C513&quality=80', 'Santosh Kol planning his fantasy team as he bets money [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]'], ['https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Prateek-Kumar-with-his-father-1689826044-e1689826388135.jpg?w=770&resize=770%2C554&quality=80', 'Lalji Dwivedi (left) is worried that his son Prateek Kumar (right) is addicted to these gaming apps [Anil Kumar Tiwari/Al Jazeera]']]",[],Business and Economy,2023-07-20,2023-07-20

    <p>The Michigan attorney general on July 18, 2023, <a href=""https://www.michigan.gov/ag/news/press-releases/2023/07/18/michigan-attorney-general-dana-nessel-charges-16-false-electors"">charged 16 people with felonies for participating in a 2020 fake electors scheme</a> to interfere with the Electoral College and overturn their state’s presidential election results.</p>

<p>This is the first time a prosecutor in any jurisdiction – state or federal – has charged people in connection with a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/trump-campaign-officials-rudy-giuliani-fake-electors/index.html"">fake electors plot designed to deny voters’ will and award the 2020 presidential election to then President Donald Trump</a>. But versions of the alleged crimes, reportedly set up by Trump’s presidential campaign, also occurred in six other battleground states. <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/fake-elector-michigan-republican-df7803fca3862be713d9d6d29fb77e81"">Investigations in some of those states are underway</a>.</p>

<p>According to Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, the Michigan 16, who range in age from 55 to 82, met secretly on December 14, 2020, in the basement of Michigan Republican Party headquarters. There, they signed their names to multiple fake certificates claiming to be Michigan’s duly elected presidential electors who could award the state’s electoral votes to the candidate they wanted – Trump – instead of Joe Biden, the candidate Michigan voters actually elected.</p>

<p>“After signing these fraudulent electoral documents, some of the false electors attempted to enter the state capitol and deliver their fabricated electoral votes to the Senate floor but were turned away,” Nessel said in a written  statement. “The false electoral documents were then conveyed to the United States Senate and the National Archives, with the intent that Vice President Pence would overturn the results of the election using the false electoral slate.”</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>In this alleged plot, each of the 16 so-called fake electors has been charged with one count of conspiracy to commit forgery; two counts of forgery;  one count of conspiracy to commit election law forgery; and two counts of election law forgery, among other charges.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is the Electoral College and how does it work?</p>

<p>The Conversation has covered the nuts and bolts of the Electoral College and the intricacies it involves. Here are four essential reads to help you understand the process.</p>

<h2>1. All 50 states and Washington, D.C., get electors</h2>

<p>The U.S. presidential election is not actually one massive election. Instead, as <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3y3BVcEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"">John A. Tures, a professor of political science at LaGrange College</a>, wrote, it’s a combination of 51 separate elections that occur in each state and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>“The winner of the popular vote in each state gets a certain number of electoral votes, and the candidate who collects at least 270 wins the presidency,” he explained.</p>

<p>The number of electoral votes each state gets is partly determined by their total populations. In addition, each state gets two electors to correspond with the U.S. senators they have and one elector for each of their representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

<p>“No state can have fewer than three electoral votes, no matter how few people live there. The same is true for the District of Columbia, which is also guaranteed at least three electoral votes,” Tures wrote.</p>

<h2>2. The electors’ role is essential to U.S. presidential elections</h2>

<p>The presidential election process in the U.S. is intricate and involves a lot of people – and time.</p>

<p>As Amy Dacey, who directs <a href=""https://www.american.edu/sine-institute/executive-director.cfm"">an academic research center on politics</a> at American University, wrote, certifying presidential elections in the U.S. is a four-month process.</p>

<p>“The unusual and complicated presidential election certification process in the U.S. entwines all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the Senate, House of Representatives, the National Archives and the Office of the Federal Register. <a href=""https://theconversation.com/who-formally-declares-the-winner-of-the-us-presidential-election-145212"">It also involves the Electoral College – a uniquely American institution</a> that convenes in 51 separate locations once every four years to pick the president,” Dacey wrote.</p>

<p>This is how it works: Every four years, Americans vote on the first Tuesday in November to elect a president. The preceding October, the archivist of the United States sends a letter to each state’s governor outlining their Electoral College responsibilities.</p>

<p>After the elections and once all the votes in each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., are in, the governors prepare their respective documents known as Certificates of Ascertainment, which list their electors for the candidates, and submit the documents to the U.S. archivist. Then, each state’s electors meet in their respective capitals on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to formally vote for president and vice president. During the meetings, the electors in each state and Washington, D.C., prepare six Certificates of Vote and send one each by registered mail to the president of the U.S. Senate, the archivist of the United States and the remaining four to state officials.</p>

<p>At that point, Electoral College electors’ duties are finished until the next presidential election.</p>

<h2>3. Congress certifies votes from the Electoral College</h2>

<p>The presidential election certification process itself concludes during a joint session of Congress in January, when members meet to tally the Electoral College votes. The proceeding is more than a formality - even if some roles within it are purely ceremonial.</p>

<p>Once the sealed Certificates of Vote from each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., are brought to the joint session – in ceremonial mahogany boxes – the president of the Senate, typically the vice president of the U.S., opens the 51 envelopes individually and hands them to the tellers - or vote counters - who announce each state’s results aloud and record the votes so they can be tallied. Then the vice president calls for objections that may exist.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/political-science/faculty/donald-brand"">Donald Brand, a professor of political science</a> at the College of the Holy Cross, wrote, it is not legally or politically possible to subvert the Electoral College.</p>

<p>“The Electoral Count Act of 1887 requires Congress to convene and review – <a href=""https://theconversation.com/why-trumps-senate-supporters-cant-overturn-electoral-college-results-they-dont-like-heres-how-the-law-actually-works-152665"">rather than simply rubber-stamp – Electoral College results</a>,” he wrote. “It puts the onus for resolving electoral disputes on the states. As long as they do so, certifying their election results no later than six days before the Electoral College meets to cast its votes, then states will enjoy ‘safe harbor’ protection. That means their results will be considered ‘conclusive’ when Congress convenes to certify the vote …”</p>

<p>Congress is required by law to defer to the states’ and Washington, D.C.’s electoral votes as long as they were in by the established deadline.</p>

<p>Still, the Electoral Count Act allows for challenges of the results through a process that involves both houses of Congress initially debating separately. 
The Electoral Count Reform Act, described below, raises the previous objection threshold. </p>

<p>“To overturn an election result, Congress would have to disqualify enough electoral votes to deprive one candidate of the 270 votes needed to win. The House would then choose the next president based on an unusual voting system specified in Article 2 of the Constitution,” Brand wrote.</p>

<h2>4. Recent legislation should prevent future attempts to overturn the presidential election</h2>

<p>Two years after people attacked the U.S. Capitol and alleged fake electors plotted to overturn results of a presidential election, Congress passed legislation that clarified ambiguous aspects of the Electoral College process so no one can steal future elections. The legislation is known as the Electoral Count Reform Act.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PSynZNoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">Derek T. Muller, an election law scholar</a> at the University of Iowa who testified on a bipartisan invitation during a Senate hearing about the importance of the legislation, wrote about several of its significant reforms, including that there’s no longer any confusion about when or if a state has failed to choose its presidential electors.</p>

<p>Before the Electoral Count Reform Act, states could legally choose their presidential electors after Election Day if they “failed to make a choice” on that day. But that created the unanswered question, when has a state “failed to make a choice” that some people attempted to exploit during the 2020 election cycle, with claims that questions about voter fraud or absentee ballots constituted such a failure. That would have opened the door for certain states to choose electors on a later date.</p>

<p>“That raised the prospect that states might send two sets of electors to Congress, a slate for the candidate who carried the popular vote and another slate, chosen later by the legislature,” Muller wrote. “And that would invite Congress to undermine the popular election results by counting the second set of electoral votes.”</p>

<p>That confusion is a thing of the past.</p>

<p>“There will be one day of choosing electors, with no possibility of a later choice. And state legislatures cannot show up after the election and attempt to change the rules – the bill mandates that state rules for how the election is run must be on the books before Election Day,” Muller wrote.</p>

<p>The Electoral Count Reform Act also creates a firm date for states to certify their election results. This particular reform was necessary because, in the past, disputes about which votes should or should not be counted lasted for weeks. But having a firm date ensures there will be a quick end to any litigation that may arise.</p>

<p>Equally important, the act also limits people’s ability to create fake slates of electors – as allegedly was done in Michigan – because of a speedy judicial review process and the definite obligations for state election officials to certify only the result that matches the outcome of the election held on Election Day.</p>

<p>Another notable reform is the requirement for one fifth of members of Congress to object to the counting of electoral votes. Prior to the Electoral Count Reform Act, it took only one member from each house of Congress to object, which opened debate on the issue.</p>

<p>“Raising the threshold makes it harder to slow down counting and increases public confidence by refusing to give attention to baseless objections,” Muller wrote.</p>

<p>The act also clarifies that the role of the vice president, as president of the Senate, in counting the electoral votes is purely ceremonial. As has always been the case, the vice president alone has no power to determine whether electoral votes should be counted.</p>

<p>Leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, certification of the 2020 presidential election, Trump repeatedly pressured former Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to count electoral votes during the joint session of Congress.</p>

<h2>What are the reasons for this impending strike?</h2>

<p>Before the talks collapsed, both sides had been negotiating extensively on a new five-year agreement that <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/07/11/ups-strike-2023-impact/70400086007/"">would cover about 340,000 unionized UPS workers</a>.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p><a href=""https://www.fleetowner.com/operations/article/21269359/freightmarket-ripples-ahead-of-possible-ups-strike"">The delivery company has agreed to some of the Teamsters’ demands</a>, pledging to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>End a two-tiered wage system in which part-time workers earn an average of about US$5 per hour less than full-time workers;</p></li>
<li><p>Make <a href=""https://nmaahc.si.edu/explore/stories/15-year-battle-martin-luther-king-jr-day"">Martin Luther King Jr. Day</a>, the third Monday of January, a paid holiday;</p></li>
<li><p>Stop requiring UPS employees to work <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ups-strike-labor-contract-teamsters-3438edf86cb006a1685e29822399a4d9"">overtime hours on their days off</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>Add fans and install <a href=""https://teamster.org/2023/06/teamsters-secure-air-conditioning-for-ups-fleet-in-major-tentative-deal/"">air conditioning in many trucks</a> to improve cooling.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The primary remaining sticking points concern <a href=""https://twitter.com/CNBCOvertime/status/1678505073641390080?"">part-time workers</a>. The Teamsters dispute UPS’s claim that part-time workers earn an average of $20 per hour. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien instead says they’re paid “<a href=""https://twitter.com/Teamsters/status/1678799645336543233"">poverty wages</a>.”</p>

<p>The Teamsters further want part-time workers to have earlier access to health insurance coverage and pension plans and a clearer pathway to full-time employment. The union also seeks to resolve safety and health concerns and “better pay for all workers,” as well as obtaining “<a href=""https://teamster.org/2023/06/ups-pleads-to-keep-bargaining-with-more-money-teamsters-demand-more-progress/"">stronger protections against managerial harassment</a>.”</p>

<p>The impasse comes after two years in which UPS posted record profits. The company cleared <a href=""https://investors.ups.com/sec-filings/annual-filings/content/0001090727-23-000006/0001090727-23-000006.pdf"">$12.9 billion and $11.5 billion</a>, respectively, in 2021 and 2022. The company <a href=""https://investors.ups.com/sec-filings/annual-filings/content/0001090727-20-000005/0001090727-20-000005.pdf"">nearly tripled its net income</a> from the levels seen in 2018 and 2019 of $4.8 billion and $4.4 billion.</p>

<p>The Teamsters argue that these record profits mean <a href=""https://teamster.org/2023/07/after-marathon-sessions-ups-negotiations-collapse/"">UPS can afford to pay higher wages</a>.</p>

<h2>What should consumers expect?</h2>

<p>If unionized UPS workers do go on strike, many U.S. consumers will surely fear delays in the delivery of their online purchases. In my view, that’s a reasonable concern, given that <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/business/ups-strike-retail-shippers.html"">UPS handles roughly 25%</a> of all U.S. package deliveries. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/US/9708/20/ups.update.early/"">1997 strike, which lasted 16 days</a>, took place when e-commerce was in its infancy. The Census Bureau only began to track that slice of the economy in 1999, when <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA"">online shopping amounted to about 0.6% of all retail sales</a>. Today, consumers spend about 15% of their shopping dollars on e-commerce purchases.</p>

<p>If a strike were to happen, UPS competitors, including FexEx Ground and the United States Postal Service, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jason-miller-32110325_supplychain-supplychainmanagement-ecommerce-activity-7084504099454390272-3iwR?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"">would likely be able to handle about 20%</a> of UPS’s deliveries because the industry currently has some excess capacity. </p>

<p>That’s due to delivery <a href=""https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES4349200007?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true"">workers clocking fewer hours per week</a> today compared to the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href=""https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES4349200034?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&amp;output_view=data&amp;include_graphs=true"">Parcel delivery demand peaked in 2021</a>, when millions of Americans were still social distancing. </p>

<p>If a prolonged strike happens, UPS could lose up to <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/consultant-strike-could-cost-ups-30-of-diverted-volume"">30% of its business</a>, experts warn, as <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/fedex-advises-ups-shippers-to-get-on-board-now"">customers switch to rival services</a>.</p>

<p>The risk of losing market share is leading many industry experts to believe that if a strike were to occur, <a href=""https://www.fleetowner.com/operations/article/21269359/freightmarket-ripples-ahead-of-possible-ups-strike"">it wouldn’t last long</a>.</p>

<h2>What about businesses?</h2>

<p>Roughly 57.3% of the packages UPS delivers <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tough-quarter-starts-the-year-for-ups"">are shipped straight to consumers</a>. The rest go to retailers and other businesses.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=g_BdG-cAAAAJ"">my years of researching</a> transportation operations and supply chain disruptions, I believe Americans should recognize that the impact of a UPS strike would stretch far beyond delayed delivery of everything from pet food to tennis rackets that they buy online.</p>

<p>A UPS strike could disrupt the availability of <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2023/07/11/ups-strike-2023-impact/70400086007/"">spare parts for cars</a> and <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/07/12/1187354600/ups-workers-could-be-on-course-for-a-historic-strike-within-weeks"">wholesale medical supplies</a>, just to name a few essentials. Consumers will also find it harder to get clothing and shoes in stores, as retail locations are typically replenished by parcel carriers. </p>

<p>The supply chain for manufacturing computer and electronics products would probably be disrupted too, according to <a href=""https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/econ/cfs/historical-datasets.html"">my analysis of data</a> from the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics that <a href=""https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cfs/technical-documentation/methodology/2017cfsmethodology.pdf"">tracks how different industries transport products to their customers</a>. Farmers and construction companies trying to get spare parts for heavy equipment would see delays in those shipments, which might result in downtime that costs tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Consequently, a strike would leave many businesses scrambling to fulfill customers’ orders, which may force them to spend more money on higher-priced air freight shipping. </p>

<p>Even a 10-day strike could <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/economy/ups-strike-economic-impact/index.html"">cost the U.S. economy an estimated $7.1 billion</a> , according to <a href=""https://www.andersoneconomicgroup.com/potential-ups-strike-could-be-costliest-in-a-century/"">Anderson Economic Group</a> – a research firm – making it potentially the costliest strike in U.S. history. These costs stem from the 340,000 striking workers losing an estimated $1.1 billion in wages and UPS losing $816 million in earnings. The balance of this estimate would result from the disruptions incurred by UPS customers.  </p>

<h2>What do you think will happen?</h2>

<p>Unlike the threatened <a href=""https://theconversation.com/railroads-and-unions-reach-deal-to-avert-devastating-strike-keeping-americas-trains-and-the-economy-on-track-for-now-190600"">railroad strikes of 2022</a>, there is no system in place for the federal government to prevent a UPS strike. On that occasion, Congress had the option of intervening, but a deal was reached before the government had to step in.</p>

<p>However, it seems likely that there <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/ups-strike-teamsters-biden-delivery-cb586d2f6160a92cda9318d6290ac8ea"">will be calls for the White House</a> to get both parties back to the negotiating table.</p>

<p>Given that both the Teamsters and UPS have an incentive to not see the company lose customers to rival shipping operations, I believe that they may reach a deal soon enough to avoid a costly and disruptive strike. Consistent with this, UPS  announced on July 19, 2023, that it and the Teamsters will <a href=""https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ups-teamsters-to-return-to-table"">return to the negotiating table</a> before their July 31 deadline.</p>

    <p>If you ask Alexa, Amazon’s voice assistant AI system, whether Amazon is a monopoly, it responds by <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-14/amazon-s-alexa-defends-company-honor-while-jabbing-rivals"">saying it doesn’t know</a>. It doesn’t take much to make it <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-14/amazon-s-alexa-defends-company-honor-while-jabbing-rivals"">lambaste the other tech giants</a>, but it’s silent about its own corporate parent’s misdeeds.</p>

<p>When Alexa responds in this way, it’s obvious that it is putting its developer’s interests ahead of yours. Usually, though, it’s not so obvious whom an AI system is serving. To avoid being exploited by these systems, people will need to learn to approach AI skeptically. That means deliberately constructing the input you give it and thinking critically about its output.</p>

<p>Newer generations of AI models, with their more sophisticated and less rote responses, are making it harder to tell who benefits when they speak. Internet companies’ manipulating what you see to serve their own interests is nothing new. Google’s search results and your Facebook feed are <a href=""https://www.marketingweek.com/ritson-digital-duopoly-2018/"">filled with paid entries</a>. <a href=""https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/chaos-machine-book-excerpt/"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/business/media/tiktok-algorithm.html"">TikTok</a> and others manipulate your feeds to maximize the time you spend on the platform, which means more ad views, over your well-being.</p>

<p>What distinguishes AI systems from these other internet services is how interactive they are, and how these interactions will increasingly become like relationships. It doesn’t take much extrapolation from today’s technologies to envision AIs that will plan trips for you, negotiate on your behalf or act as therapists and life coaches. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>They are likely to be with you 24/7, know you intimately, and be able to anticipate your needs. This kind of conversational interface to the vast network of services and resources on the web is within the capabilities of existing generative AIs like ChatGPT. They are on track to become <a href=""https://danielmiessler.com/p/ais-next-big-thing-is-digital-assistants/"">personalized digital assistants</a>.</p>

<p>As a <a href=""https://dblp.org/pid/s/BruceSchneier.html"">security expert</a> and <a href=""https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/nathan-sanders"">data scientist</a>, we believe that people who come to rely on these AIs will have to trust them implicitly to navigate daily life. That means they will need to be sure the AIs aren’t secretly working for someone else. Across the internet, devices and services that seem to work for you already secretly work against you. Smart TVs <a href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/privacy/how-to-turn-off-smart-tv-snooping-features-a4840102036/"">spy on you</a>. Phone apps <a href=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr20/presentation/egelman"">collect and sell your data</a>. Many apps and websites <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/09/ftc-report-shows-rise-sophisticated-dark-patterns-designed-trick-trap-consumers"">manipulate you through dark patterns</a>, design elements that <a href=""https://theconversation.com/what-are-dark-patterns-an-online-media-expert-explains-165362"">deliberately mislead, coerce or deceive website visitors</a>. This is <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/books/data-and-goliath/"">surveillance capitalism</a>, and AI is shaping up to be part of it.</p>

<figure>
            <div class=""placeholder-container"" style=""--aspect-ratio-percent:56.25%;--background-color:#fff""><iframe class=""lazyload"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5AvtUrHxg8A?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0"" allowfullscreen="""" width=""100%"" height=""400"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">AI is playing a role in surveillance capitalism, which boils down to spying on you to make money off you.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>In the dark</h2>

<p>Quite possibly, it could be much worse with AI. For that AI digital assistant to be truly useful, it will have to really know you. Better than your phone knows you. Better than Google search knows you. Better, perhaps, than your close friends, intimate partners and therapist know you.</p>

<p>You have no reason to trust today’s leading generative AI tools. Leave aside the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html"">hallucinations</a>, the made-up “facts” that GPT and other large language models produce. We expect those will be largely cleaned up as the technology improves over the next few years. </p>

<p>But you don’t know how the AIs are configured: how they’ve been trained, what information they’ve been given, and what instructions they’ve been commanded to follow. For example, researchers <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/23599441/microsoft-bing-ai-sydney-secret-rules"">uncovered the secret rules</a> that govern the Microsoft Bing chatbot’s behavior. They’re largely benign but can change at any time.</p>

<h2>Making money</h2>

<p>Many of these AIs are created and trained at enormous expense by some of the largest tech monopolies. They’re being offered to people to use free of charge, or at very low cost. These companies will need to monetize them somehow. And, as with the rest of the internet, that somehow is likely to include surveillance and manipulation.</p>

<p>Imagine asking your chatbot to plan your next vacation. Did it choose a particular airline or hotel chain or restaurant because it was the best for you or because its maker got a kickback from the businesses? As with paid results in Google search, newsfeed ads on Facebook and paid placements on Amazon queries, these paid influences are likely to get more surreptitious over time.</p>

<p>If you’re asking your chatbot for political information, are the results skewed by the politics of the corporation that owns the chatbot? Or the candidate who paid it the most money? Or even the views of the demographic of the people whose data was used in training the model? Is your AI agent secretly a double agent? Right now, there is no way to know.</p>

<h2>Trustworthy by law</h2>

<p>We believe that people should expect more from the technology and that tech companies and AIs can become more trustworthy. The European Union’s proposed <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230505IPR84904/ai-act-a-step-closer-to-the-first-rules-on-artificial-intelligence"">AI Act</a> takes some important steps, requiring transparency about the data used to train AI models, mitigation for potential bias, disclosure of foreseeable risks and reporting on industry standard tests.</p>

<figure>
            <div class=""placeholder-container"" style=""--aspect-ratio-percent:56.25%;--background-color:#fff""><iframe class=""lazyload"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcOQYj9zcqw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0"" allowfullscreen="""" width=""100%"" height=""400"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">The European Union is pushing ahead with AI regulation.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Most existing AIs <a href=""https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/06/15/eu-ai-act.html"">fail to comply</a> with this emerging European mandate, and, despite <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-call-hands-deck-approach-regulating-ai-rcna90193"">recent prodding</a> from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the U.S. is far behind on such regulation.</p>

<p>The AIs of the future should be trustworthy. Unless and until the government delivers robust consumer protections for AI products, people will be on their own to guess at the potential risks and biases of AI, and to mitigate their worst effects on people’s experiences with them. </p>

<p>So when you get a travel recommendation or political information from an AI tool, approach it with the same skeptical eye you would a billboard ad or a campaign volunteer. For all its technological wizardry, the AI tool may be little more than the same.</p>

  <div class=""grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
    <p>Each year for the past six decades, congressional representatives from both sides of the aisle have come together to pass the National Defense Authorization Act. Because the bill involves the military – <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx"">a traditionally popular institution</a> – it has historically received bipartisan support. </p>

<p>But that record was threatened in the Republican-led House of Representatives on July 14, 2023, when <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/14/house-passes-defense-bill-despite-controversial-abortion-transgender-policies-00106373"">members passed the US$886 billion bill by a 219-210 mostly party-line vote</a>. Reflecting the current polarized politics of the U.S., the bill stands virtually no chance of passing in the Democratic-controlled Senate without major modifications. </p>

<p>The measure lacked full support in the House not because of differences over military funding itself, but because it included Republican amendments that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/politics/house-ndaa-vote-amendments/index.html"">put restrictions on diversity training</a>, abortion access and medical care for transgender troops.</p>

<p>Just after the bill’s passage, <a href=""https://twitter.com/SpeakerMcCarthy/status/1679890062148874241"">House Speaker Kevin McCarthy tweeted</a>, “We don’t want Disneyland to train our military,” and “House Republicans just passed the bill that ENDS the wokism in the military and gives our troops the biggest pay raise in decades.”</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>As <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=6P3QreQAAAAJ"">scholars of American politics</a>, we study Congress and <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=lQycyuAAAAAJ"">believe that this unusual politicization of the defense budget</a> could affect other important legislation in Washington.</p>

<h2>A look at the National Defense Authorization Act and what’s happening in 2023</h2>

<p>Since 1961, <a href=""https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10515"">Congress has approved defense spending</a> annually using a two-step process. The first and current step, the National Defense Authorization Act, sets defense policies and provides guidance on how money can be spent. In the second step, which will come after the Senate votes on its version of the bill and the two chambers reach a compromise version, the House and Senate Appropriations Committees approve the spending. </p>

<p>But <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades/"">Congress has become increasingly polarized</a> over the years. Congressional Republicans have grown more conservative, congressional Democrats have become more liberal, and <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2022/03/17/polarization-congress-democrats-republicans-house-senate-data"">members of the two parties agree on less and less</a>. </p>

<p>In the first year of the Biden administration, <a href=""https://rollcall.com/2021/09/23/house-nears-vote-on-final-passage-of-defense-policy-bill/"">the House approved the National Defense Authorization Act</a> by a 316-113 margin. In 2022, the  act <a href=""https://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2022/12/08/house-passes-defense-bill-with-more-taiwan-ukraine-security-aid/"">passed the House by a 350-80 margin</a>. As points of comparison, the <a href=""https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2002158"">2002 version of the bill passed 359-58 in the House</a>, and the <a href=""https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2003221"">2003 version passed 361-68 in the House</a>. The reauthorization process happens the year before the act goes into effect.</p>

<p>During the 2023 reauthorization process, the bill included amendments from the most conservative members of the Republican Party, many of them from the House Freedom Caucus, who, according to their Twitter profile, support, in part, <a href=""https://twitter.com/freedomcaucus?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"">open, accountable and limited government</a>. The amendments seek to <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passage-defense-bill-question-gop-abortion-transgender-surgery-a-rcna94196"">ban the Department of Defense from paying</a> <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/4100215-mccaul-very-confident-ndaa-will-be-a-bipartisan-bill/"">travel expense reimbursements</a> for service members getting an abortion or transgender surgeries and hormone treatments. </p>

<p>The debates over the amendments were particularly heated. As just one example, <a href=""https://twitter.com/RepRosendale/status/1679603332732669952"">House Freedom Caucus member Matt Rosendale tweeted</a>, “If someone does not know if they are a man or a woman, they should not be having their hand on a missile launch button.” </p>

<p>Democrats like Rep. Jim McGovern decried House Freedom Caucus tactics: “It’s outrageous that a small <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mccarthy-working-satisfy-gop-hard-liners-demanding-culture/story?id=101170953"">minority of MAGA extremists is dictating</a> how we’ll proceed.” </p>

<p>For the <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/legislative-hardball/37488C1E94117DFBFF924E5B67188E07"">House Freedom Caucus</a>, this was an opportunity to advance its conservative agenda and try to reverse the policies of the Democratic administration. At the same time, these types of amendments decreased the odds that the bill would receive bipartisan support. </p>

<h2>Previous defense spending bills have addressed social policy, too</h2>

<p>This is not the first version of the defense authorization bill that included language about social issues. One reporter wrote in 2022 that the National Defense Authorization Act’s record of bipartisan support “has also made the bill a popular vehicle <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/national-defense-authorization-act-5113289"">for tacking on legislation that</a> has little to do with defense.”</p>

<p>In one notable example, the <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/5006/text"">1993 National Defense Authorization Act</a> included the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” compromise, which allowed gay and lesbian citizens to serve in the military if they did not make their sexual orientation public. The measure <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7249/mg1056osd.10?seq=4"">stemmed from President Bill Clinton’s campaign pledge</a> to lift the ban on gay people serving in the military. But once in office, Clinton met substantial opposition to his proposal from military leaders and their congressional allies. </p>

<p>The stalemate could have been resolved only by an executive order, which Congress opposed, or legislation, which Clinton opposed. “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” <a href=""https://time.com/5339634/dont-ask-dont-tell-25-year-anniversary/"">was middle ground</a>. Seventeen years later, Democratic President Barack Obama <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2010/12/22/president-signs-repeal-dont-ask-dont-tell-out-many-we-are-one"">signed a bill ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell</a>. </p>

<p>Another example of social policy’s being embedded in the National Defense Authorization Act occurred in 2009, when Senate Democrats attached <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/crt/matthew-shepard-and-james-byrd-jr-hate-crimes-prevention-act-2009-0"">the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act</a>, which strengthened federal protections against crimes based on race, religion or nationality and added protections against crimes based on gender, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation, to the annual defense authorization bill. It <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2009/10/senate-passes-hate-crimes-bill-028640"">passed by a 68-29 vote in the Senate</a>, but since the House and Senate had different versions of the bill, a conference committee reconciled the differences. The hate crimes provision remained, and the legislation <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/28/hate.crimes/"">was signed by President Obama</a>. </p>

<p>The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act included several provisions added by the Democratic-controlled Senate addressing the equitable treatment of women in the military. Among them: <a href=""https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2012/12/women-military-defense-authorization-bill/"">insurance coverage for abortions in cases of rape and incest</a>; mandatory discharge of convicted sex offenders; and mandatory sexual assault prevention training. The Senate version of the bill <a href=""https://thehill.com/policy/defense/136164-senate-passes-631b-defense-policy-bill-98-0/"">passed 98-0</a>. The provisions remained after the House and Senate reconciled their versions and were <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4310/text"">part of the bill President Obama signed</a>. </p>

<p>More recently, the <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/05/pentagon-confederate-name-bases-455180"">2021 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision to remove</a> Confederate names, symbols and monuments from Department of Defense property. <a href=""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/23/senate-defense-bill-ndaa-bases-trump-380362"">Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren sponsored</a> the measure in the Senate, and <a href=""https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2020/06/11/congress-could-force-name-change-at-military-bases-honoring-confederate-generals/"">Rep. Anthony Brown, Democrat from Maryland, and Rep. Don Bacon, Republican from Nebraska</a>, sponsored it in the House. There was enough bipartisan support for that legislation that the House and Senate <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2021/01/01/952450018/congress-overturns-trump-veto-on-defense-bill-after-political-detour"">overrode President Donald Trump’s veto</a>.</p>

<h2>What each party stands to gain or lose from this fight</h2>

<p>The narrow House victory will represent a policy win for the House Freedom Caucus, help members raise money for future election cycles and lessen the likelihood that members will be <a href=""https://www.press.umich.edu/5181079/getting_primaried"">challenged in a primary</a> from the right flank of their party. </p>

<p>At the same time, these tactics may make it easier for Democrats to win in crucial <a href=""https://www.cookpolitical.com/cook-pvi/2023-partisan-voting-index/118-district-map-and-list"">swing districts</a> during the 2024 election cycle. Likely providing a preview of talking points Democrats will use against Republicans in swing districts, <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/07/14/1187660777/house-passes-defense-bill-mostly-along-party-lines-with-culture-war-measures-att"">Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said</a>, “Extreme MAGA Republicans have chosen to hijack the historically bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act to continue attacking reproductive freedom and jamming the right-wing ideology down the throats of the American people.” </p>

<p>Defense reauthorization was once considered a rare policy issue on which the parties could agree. Bu, the Republican-led House’s passage of a bill with little Democratic support most likely renders the bill dead on arrival in the Senate, where Democrats are in the majority. </p>

<p>It’s an important sign that there’s no longer an issue that’s immune from the hyperpolarization that defines today’s American politics.</p>

    <p>Despite misconceptions and <a href=""https://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/2015/10/30/the-stereotype-stereotype/"">stereotypes</a> – ranging from what librarians Gretchen Keer and Andrew Carlos have described as the “middle-aged, bun-wearing, comfortably shod, shushing librarian” to the “sexy librarian … and the hipster or tattooed librarian” – library professionals are more than book jockeys, and they do more than read at story time. </p>

<p>They are experts in classification, pedagogy, data science, social media, disinformation, health sciences, music, art, media literacy and, yes, storytelling.</p>

<p>And right now, librarians are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/books/book-ban-librarians.html"">taking on an old role</a>. <a href=""https://www.ala.org/tools/challengesupport"">They are defending the rights</a> of readers and writers in the battles raging across the U.S. over censorship, book challenges and book bans. </p>

<p>Book challenges are an <a href=""https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/banned-books-qa"">attempt to remove a title from circulation</a>, and <a href=""https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/986/book-banning"">bans mean the actual removal of a book</a> from library shelves. The current spate of bans and challenges is the most notable and intense since the <a href=""https://libraryleadershippodcast.com/103-dealing-with-book-banning-with-tracie-d-hall/"">McCarthy era</a>, when censorship campaigns during that Cold War period of political repression <a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/119516/report-book-burning-under-huac-and-eisenhower"">included public book burnings</a>. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>But these battles are not new; book banning can be <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/history-of-book-bans-in-the-united-states"">traced back to 1637</a> in the U.S., when the <a href=""https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/in-1650-william-pynchon-tweaks-the-puritans/"">Puritans banned a book</a> by Massachusetts Bay colonist William Pynchon they saw as heretical. </p>

<p>As long as there have been book challenges, there have been those <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/history-of-book-bans-in-the-united-states"">who defend intellectual freedom and the right to read freely</a>. Librarians and library workers have long been <a href=""https://www.alastore.ala.org/content/intellectual-freedom-manual-tenth-edition"">crucial players in the defense of books and ideas</a>. At the 2023 annual American Library Association Conference, <a href=""https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/92618-freedom-fighters-ibram-x-kendi-kicks-off-ala-2023-with-a-powerful-message-to-librarians.html"">scholar Ibram X. Kendi</a> praised library professionals and reminded them that “if you’re fighting book bans, if you’re fighting against censorship, then you are a freedom fighter.”</p>

<p>Library professionals maintain that books are what education scholar Rudine Sims Bishop called the “<a href=""https://www.greatschoolspartnership.org/mirrors-windows-and-sliding-glass-doors-a-metaphor-for-reading-and-life/"">mirrors</a>, windows and sliding glass doors” that allow readers to learn about themselves and others and gain empathy for those who are different from them. </p>

<p>The drive to challenge, ban or censor books has not only changed the lives of librarians across the nation. It’s also changing the way librarians are now educated to enter the profession. As a <a href=""https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/cooke_nicole.php"">library school educator</a>, I hear the anecdotes, questions and concerns from library workers who are on the front lines of the current fight and are not sure how to react or respond.  </p>

<p>What once, and still is, a curriculum that includes book selection, program planning and serving diverse communities in the classroom, my faculty colleagues and I are now expanding to include discussions and resources on how students, once they become professional librarians, can physically, legally and financially protect themselves and their organizations. </p>

<h2>More than shelving books</h2>

<p>Degreed librarians are professionals with master’s degrees from nationally <a href=""https://www.ala.org/educationcareers/accreditedprograms"">accredited</a> academic programs. I have personally gone through such a program and now teach in one.  </p>

<p>In fact, many librarians who work on college and university campuses have subject masters and doctorates, and K-12 librarians must have a valid teaching license or a state endorsement to <a href=""https://www.everylibraryinstitute.org/requirements_to_become_a_school_librarian_by_state"">work in a school library or media center</a>. They know how to select appropriate materials for communities. </p>

<p><a href=""https://uniteagainstbookbans.org/"">Librarians</a> adhere to <a href=""https://www.ala.org/advocacy/advocacy/intfreedom/corevalues"">core values</a>, standards and <a href=""https://www.ala.org/tools/ethics"">professional ethics</a>. They see it as their duty to create and maintain a collection that reflects the diverse needs and interests of the entire community, not just for a select, vocal part of the community.  The <a href=""https://www.ala.org/tools/challengesupport/selectionpolicytoolkit/coredocuments"">Freedom to Read statement</a> of the American Library Association tells us: “It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians, as guardians of the people’s freedom to read, to contest encroachments upon that freedom by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large; and by the government whenever it seeks to reduce or deny public access to public information.”</p>

<p>Books are challenged and banned for many <a href=""https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10"">reasons</a>, including profanity, depictions of sex, LGBTQIA+ content, depictions of sexual abuse, equity, diversity and inclusion content, depictions of drug use and alcoholism, anti-police rhetoric and providing sex education. <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2022/06/09/rise-book-bans-explained/"">Reasons for challenges</a> can be personally subjective, and claims that books present divisive topics that should be excluded from collections are <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/books/book-ban-us-schools.html"">increasing</a>.</p>

<p>George Johnson, author of the frequently banned book <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/10/25/1130433140/banned-books-all-boys-arent-blue-george-johnson-lgbtq-ya"">“All Boys aren’t Blue,</a>” has said that he believes books are challenged to eliminate <a href=""https://time.com/6261238/george-m-johnson-book-bans-censorship-interview/"">narratives</a> that elucidate the truths of marginalized groups and depict the everyday diversity of their lives. Johnson believes the stories of the LGBTQIA+ and minoritized communities are specifically under attack. </p>

<h2>The new librarians’ education</h2>

<p>To balance the needs of everyone in the community, <a href=""https://www.ala.org/tools/atoz/Collection%20Development/collectiondevelopment"">libraries have collection development policies</a> as well as <a href=""https://www.ala.org/tools/challengesupport/selectionpolicytoolkit/statement"">reconsideration and withdrawal policies</a> that guide librarians in selecting new books and materials and removing those that are outdated. These policies are key when facing potential bans and challenges. </p>

<p>But with the current controversies about racially diverse and LGBTQIA+ books, policies are no longer enough to demonstrate the integrity of professionally curated library collections. </p>

<p>Neither policies nor book reviews nor professional expertise are keeping library workers from being called <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/books/book-ban-librarians.html"">pedophiles, groomers, indoctrinators and pornographers</a>. They are <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-01-27/school-librarians-vilified-as-the-arm-of-satan-in-book-banning-wars"">being harassed</a>, <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/a-school-librarian-pushes-back-on-censorship-and-gets-death-threats-and-online-harassment/2022/09"">receiving death threats</a> and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/books/book-ban-librarians.html"">being fired</a>. <a href=""https://www.5newsonline.com/article/news/politics/crawford-county-parents-sue-library-lgbtq-books/527-6d8b5d95-b541-4ba2-bf5a-ef6d97bc9e33"">Libraries have been sued</a> and library workers are so threatened and harassed that <a href=""https://www.slj.com/story/from-the-breaking-point-to-fighting-anew-school-librarian-martha-hickson-shares-her-story-of-battling-book-banning-censorship"">they are getting sick</a> <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/06/books/book-ban-librarians.html#:%7E:text=Many%20librarians%20have%20quit%20%E2%80%94%20or,demanded%2C%20according%20to%20a%20lawsuit"">and leaving their careers</a>.</p>

<p>The current threats to librarians and the books they circulate are necessitating a shift in the content of graduate library education. Librarians obviously need to know the content of books. But educators like me now know we need to provide graduate students with information about how to physically and legally protect themselves and their organizations. </p>

<p>When we teach intellectual freedom, we also teach students how to prepare for protesters and contentious board meetings. When we teach information professionals how to select materials for their libraries, we emphasize their need to know how to articulate, in writing, the reasons for having a particular book, film or material item in their collection.  </p>

<p>I believe that our students now need to consider getting professional liability insurance in case they are sued for buying a contested book. And when we teach story-time planning, we can pair that with strategies to devise a <a href=""https://www.courierpress.com/story/news/2019/02/02/heres-lowdown-so-far-drag-queen-story-hour-evansville/2740490002/"">safety plan</a> in case they are threatened or receive a bomb threat because of their work. </p>

<p>Librarians and the future librarians we teach have always loved books and reading. While our work has changed in this era of increasing censorship, in one sense it has not: We’re still devoted to the idea that we serve our communities by providing them with books that open the world to them and give them the opportunity to learn about themselves and others.</p>

<p>I’m a <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3jf-nyIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"">health economist</a> who has studied the pharmaceutical industry for the past 15 years. I believe the drug shortage problem illustrates a major shortcoming of capitalism. While costly brand-name drugs often yield high profits to manufacturers, there’s relatively little money to be made in supplying the market with low-cost generics, no matter how vital they may be to patients’ health. </p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">The shortage includes chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics, medications to treat ADHD and other critical drugs. Some patients are able to get their drugs, while others are not, and in some cases patients are getting ‘rationed care.’</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>A generic problem</h2>

<p>The problem boils down to the nature of the pharmaceutical industry and how differently the markets for brand and generic drugs operate. Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the fact that <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2956.html"">prices of brand drugs in the U.S. are among the highest</a> in the developed world, while generic drug prices are among the lowest. </p>

<p>When a drugmaker develops a new pill, cream or solution, the government grants the company an exclusive patent for up to 20 years, although most patents are filed before clinical testing, and thus the effective patent life is closer to eight to 12 years. Nonetheless, patents allow the drugmakers to cover the cost of research and development and earn a profit without the threat of competition from a rival making an identical product.</p>

<p>But once the patent expires, the drug becomes generic and any company is allowed to manufacture it. Since generic manufacturers are essentially producing the same product, profits are determined by their ability to manufacture the drug at the lowest marginal cost. This often results in low profit margins and can lead to cost-cutting measures that can compromise quality and threaten supply. </p>

<h2>Outsourced production creates more supply risks</h2>

<p>One of the consequences of generics’ meager margins is that drug companies outsource production to lower-cost countries.</p>

<p>As of mid-2019, 72% of the manufacturing facilities making active ingredients for drugs sold in the U.S. <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/congressional-testimony/safeguarding-pharmaceutical-supply-chains-global-economy-10302019"">were located overseas</a>, with India and China alone making up nearly half of that. </p>

<p>While overseas manufacturers often <a href=""https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/3842481d-7bc7-532b-8cd2-ab30f57c6519/content"">enjoy significant cost advantages</a> over U.S. facilities, such as easy access to raw materials and lower labor costs, outsourcing production at such a scale raises a slew of issues that can hurt the supply. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/13/science/13drug.html?pagewanted=al"">Foreign factories are more difficult</a> for the <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-fdas-lax-oversight-of-research-in-developing-countries-can-do-harm-to-vulnerable-participants-170515"">Food and Drug Administration to inspect</a>, tend to have more production problems and are far more likely than domestic factories to be shut down once a problem is discovered. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/congressional-testimony/safeguarding-pharmaceutical-supply-chains-global-economy-10302019"">In testimony to a House subcommittee</a>, Janet Woodcock, the FDA’s principal deputy commissioner, acknowledged that the agency has little information on which Chinese facilities are producing raw ingredients, how much they are producing, or where the ingredients they are producing are being distributed worldwide. </p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the country’s reliance on foreign suppliers – and the risks this poses to U.S. consumers.</p>

<p>India is the world’s largest producer of generic drugs but imports 70% of its raw materials from China. About <a href=""https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/cidrap-covid19-viewpoint-part6.pdf"">one-third of factories</a> in China shut down during the pandemic. To ensure domestic supplies, the Indian government restricted the export of medications, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/business/coronavirus-india-drugs.html"">disrupting the global supply chain</a>. This led to shortages of drugs to treat COVID-19, such as for respiratory failure and sedation, as well as for a wide range of other conditions, <a href=""https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/drug-shortages-amid-the-covid19-pandemic"">like drugs to treat chemotherapy</a>, heart disease and bacterial infections. </p>

<h2>Low profits hurt quality</h2>

<p>Manufacturing drugs to consistently high quality standards requires constant testing and evaluation. </p>

<p>A company that sells a new, expensive, branded drug has a strong profit motive to keep quality and production high. That’s often not the case for generic drug manufacturers, and <a href=""https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/02/bring-manufacturing-generic-drugs-back-to-u-s/"">this can result in shortages</a>. </p>

<p>In 2008, an adulterated version of the blood-thinning drug Heparin <a href=""https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/generic-drug-safety-us-regulators-struggle-global-market"">was recalled worldwide</a> after being linked to 350 adverse events and 150 deaths in the U.S. alone.</p>

<p>In 2013, the Department of Justice <a href=""https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/generic-drug-manufacturer-ranbaxy-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-to-pay-500-million-to-resolve-false-claims-allegations-cgmp-violations-and-false-statements-to-the-fda/#"">fined the U.S. subsidiary of Ranbaxy Laboratories</a>, India’s largest generic drug manufacturer, US$500 million after it pleaded guilty to civil and criminal charges related to drug safety and falsifying safety data. In response, the FDA banned products made at four of the company’s manufacturing facilities in India from entering the U.S., <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/business/global/ranbaxy-in-500-million-settlement-of-generic-drug-case.html"">including generic versions of gabapentin</a>, which treats epilepsy and nerve pain, and the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.</p>

<p>And while there may be multiple companies selling the same generic drug in the U.S., there may be only a single manufacturer supplying the basic ingredients. Thus, any hiccup in production or shutdown due to quality issues can affect the entire market.</p>

<p>A recent analysis found that approximately 40% of generic drugs sold in the U.S. <a href=""https://ssrn.com/abstract=3011139"">have just one manufacturer</a>, and the share of markets supplied by just one or two manufacturers has increased over time. </p>

<h2>Repatriating the drug supply</h2>

<p>It is hard to quantify the impact of drug shortages on population health. However, a recent survey of U.S. hospitals, pharmacists and other health care providers found that drug shortages <a href=""https://www.usp.org/sites/default/files/usp/document/supply-chain/pediatric-oncology-drugs-and-supply-chain.pdf"">led to increased medication errors</a>, delayed administration of lifesaving therapies, inferior outcomes and patient deaths.  </p>

<p>What can be done?</p>

<p>One option is to simply find ways to produce more generic drugs in the U.S.</p>

<p>California <a href=""https://nashp.org/california-enacts-law-to-produce-generic-prescription-drugs/#"">passed a law</a> in 2020 to do just that by allowing the state to contract with domestic manufactures to produce its own generic prescription drugs. In March 2023, California <a href=""https://californiahealthline.org/news/article/california-generic-insulin-contract-civica-rx-newsom/"">selected a Utah company</a> to begin producing low-cost insulin for California patients.</p>

<p>Whether this approach is feasible on a broader scale is uncertain, but, in my view, it’s a good first attempt to repatriate America’s drug supply.</p>

    <p><em>The Russia-Ukraine grain deal that <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/wheat-rises-9-as-russia-warns-on-safety-of-ships-to-ukraine?srnd=markets-vp&amp;sref=Hjm5biAW"">has been critical to keeping global food prices stable</a> and preventing famine is currently in tatters. On July 17, 2023, Russia <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/europe/russia-ukraine-grain-deal-intl/index.html"">said it was pulling out</a> of the year-old deal, which allowed shipments of grains and other foodstuffs to travel past the Russian naval blockade in the Black Sea. And to make matters worse, over the next two days Russia <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-odesa-crimea-1676e6e746c888c8c8c1f0e4493be6fa"">bombed the Ukrainian grain port of Odesa</a>, destroying over 60,000 tons of grain.</em></p>

<p><em><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/russia-ukraine-grain-deal-what-does-it-mean-for-global-food-prices.html"">As a result, food prices have surged</a>, with the cost of wheat, corn and soybeans in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere all skyrocketing.</em> </p>

<p><em>So, what is the grain deal, and why is it so important to the global food supply chain?</em>  </p>

She explains how important Ukrainian grain is to feeding the world – and why the Black Sea is a vital route to getting it to people who need it.</em></p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<h2>What makes Ukraine such an important part of the global food supply chain?</h2>

<p>Ukraine <a href=""https://www.farminglife.com/country-and-farming/why-is-ukraine-known-as-the-breadbasket-of-europe-heres-what-it-produces-and-exports-3584361#"">has been called the breadbasket</a> of Europe and is a major supplier of wheat, barley, sunflower products and corn to Europe as well as to developing countries such as in the Middle East, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/in-egypt-where-a-meal-isnt-complete-without-bread-war-in-ukraine-is-threatening-the-wheat-supply-and-access-to-this-staple-food-179361"">Northern Africa</a> and China. </p>

<p>More than <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/black-sea-grain-initiative-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-f17649e0"">400 million people relied on foodstuffs from Ukraine</a> before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.</p>

<p>One key reason for that is Ukraine has approximately <a href=""https://www.cesifo.org/DocDL/econpol-forum-2023-2-cramon-taubadel-nivievskyi-agricultural-perspective.pdf#:%7E:text=Agriculture%20is%20a%20key%20sector%20of%20the%20Ukrainian,Ukrainian%20GDP%20amounts%20to%20roughly%2020%20per-%20cent."">one-third of the world’s most fertile soil</a>, which is known as chernozem, or black soil. And before the war, Ukraine was able to rely on its year-round access to ice-free harbors in the Black Sea to ship grains to nearby markets in the Middle East and Africa.</p>

<h2>What happened when war broke out?</h2>

<p>Even before the war, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/war-in-ukraine-is-pushing-global-acute-hunger-to-the-highest-level-in-this-century-181414"">famine was increasing</a> across the globe. Russia’s invasion made it a lot worse. </p>

<p>From 2019 to 2022, <a href=""https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2023-122-million-more-people-pushed-into-hunger-since-2019-due-to-multiple-crises--reveals-un-report"">more than 122 million people were driven into hunger</a> by a combination of the impacts of climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the United Nations said in a recent report. <a href=""https://theconversation.com/war-in-ukraine-is-pushing-global-acute-hunger-to-the-highest-level-in-this-century-181414"">Other researchers have suggested</a> global hunger is the highest it’s been since at least the early 2000s.</p>

<p>From February to June 2022, at least <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/world/europe/ukraine-grain-shortages.html#:%7E:text=The%20war%20has%20halted%20those%20shipments%2C%20leaving%20around,is%20expected%20to%20be%20harvested%20in%20coming%20months."">25 million tons of Ukrainian grain</a> intended for global markets got trapped in Ukraine because of Russia’s naval blockade, causing food prices to jump.</p>

<h2>How did the grain deal come about?</h2>

<p>The U.N. and Turkey <a href=""https://unctad.org/news/black-sea-grain-initiative-extended"">brokered what is officially known as the Black Sea Grain Deal</a> with Ukraine and Russia on July 22, 2022.</p>

<p>The agreement allowed for the secure passage of agricultural products from Ukraine from three ports on the Black Sea, including its largest port, Odesa. While the original agreement <a href=""https://unctad.org/news/black-sea-grain-initiative-what-it-and-why-its-important-world"">was to last 120 days</a>, <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/black-sea-grain-initiative/updates"">it has been extended several times</a> since. </p>

<p>Ukraine <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2023/07/17/russia-ends-agreement-on-ukraine-exports/70419389007/"">has exported more than 32 million tons of food products</a> through the Black Sea since August 2022. The <a href=""https://www.wfp.org/"">World Food Program</a>, the world’s largest humanitarian agency,
<a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-says-it-is-pulling-out-of-ukraine-grain-deal-68190d1"">purchased 80% of its wheat from Ukraine</a>. Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Turkey have been <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-says-it-is-pulling-out-of-ukraine-grain-deal-68190d1"">the biggest recipients</a> of humanitarian shipments.</p>

<p>The U.N. has estimated that <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/black-sea-grain-initiative-vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelensky-f17649e0"">the grain deal has reduced food prices</a> by more than 23% since March 2022.</p>

<p>The amount of grain shipped per month had already been falling before the deal fell apart in July 2023, <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-grain-food-security-ba7f9146b745337a1948a964cb30331c"">from a peak of 4.2 million metric tons in October</a> to about 2 million tons in June. This is primarily because of <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-says-it-is-pulling-out-of-ukraine-grain-deal-68190d1"">slowdowns in the number of inspections</a> Russians had been conducting before ships could exit the Black Sea. </p>

<p>Another problem generally is falling production. Ukraine <a href=""https://www.ifpri.org/blog/regional-war-global-consequences-mounting-damages-ukraines-agriculture-and-growing-challenges"">is expected to produce</a> 31% less wheat, barley, corn and other crops during the current season that it did before the war. And this estimate came before <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-09/supply-chain-latest-food-production-to-suffer-after-ukraine-dam-disaster"">the destruction of a key Ukrainian dam</a> flooded fields.</p>

<h2>Why is the Black Sea so important for Ukrainian exports?</h2>

<p>Colleagues at UMass Amherst and the Kyiv School of Economics and I published a study in May 2023 that <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/s10898-023-01292-x"">showed just how vital</a> the Black Sea ports are to ensuring Ukrainian grain gets out to the world. Before the war, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-grain-deal-farmer-idAFKBN2YZ0N3"">90% of Ukraine’s agricultural exports</a> were transported on the Black Sea.</p>

<p>While Ukraine also ships its grain and other food over land through Europe, doing so costs a lot more and takes more time than sea exports. And transportation costs over land were rising because of the war as a result of mines, the destruction of agricultural infrastructure and other challenges. </p>

<h2>Why did Russia say it’s pulling out of the deal?</h2>

<p>Russia has threatened to exit the deal before, but each time it has chosen to stay in. </p>

<p>But on July 17, 2023, it said it’s <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russia-suspends-deal-allowing-ukraine-to-export-grain-destabilizing-global-food-markets"">unwilling to stay in the deal</a> unless its demands are met to ship more of its own food and fertilizer. Over the following two days, it attacked Odesa with drones and missiles in one of the largest sustained assaults on the port. Russia also said it would deem any ship in the Black Sea bound for a Ukrainian port to be <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/19/world/russia-ukraine-news"">a legitimate military target</a>. </p>

<p>This caused the <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/wheat-rises-9-as-russia-warns-on-safety-of-ships-to-ukraine?srnd=markets-vp&amp;sref=Hjm5biAW"">price of critical commodities</a> such as wheat and corn to soar and created vast uncertainty and global concern around hunger. Chicago wheat futures, a global benchmark, <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZW=F/"">are up about 17%</a> since Russia left the deal.</p>

<p>While Russia has extended the deal after previous threats, this time may be different. Russian strikes caused extensive damage to Odesa, which may severely limit Ukraine’s ability to export through the port in the future – deal or no deal. </p>

<p>I believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin <a href=""https://theconversation.com/starving-civilians-is-an-ancient-military-tactic-but-today-its-a-war-crime-in-ukraine-yemen-tigray-and-elsewhere-184297"">is weaponizing food</a> at a time of growing hunger. I only hope goodwill prevails and somehow Ukraine’s vital exports are allowed to continue.</p>

    <p>Extreme heat has been breaking records <a href=""https://www.copernicus.eu/en/media/image-day-gallery/heatwave-grips-southern-europe"">across Europe</a>, <a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/dangerous-heat-waves-hit-parts-of-asia-us-and-europe/video-66251132"">Asia</a> and <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/global-heat-wave-weather-temperatures-07-18-23/index.html"">North America</a>, with millions of people sweltering in heat and humidity well above “normal” for days on end.</p>

<p>Death Valley hit a temperature of <a href=""https://twitter.com/NWSVegas/status/1680701657167048704"">128 degrees Fahrenheit</a> (53.3 degrees Celsius) on July 16, 2023 – not quite the world’s hottest day on record, but close. Phoenix broke a record heat streak with <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-weather/2023/07/18/phoenix-hits-110-degrees-for-record-19th-day-in-a-row/70426475007/"">19 straight days</a> with temperatures above 110 F (43.3 C), and had more in the forecast, accompanied by several nights that never got below 90 F (32.2 C). Globally, Earth likely had its <a href=""https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/preliminary-data-shows-hottest-week-record-unprecedented-sea-surface-temperatures-and"">hottest week on modern record</a> in early July.</p>

<p>Heat waves are <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-16970-7"">becoming supercharged as the climate changes</a> – lasting longer, becoming more frequent and getting just plain hotter. </p>

<p>One question a lot of people are asking is: “When will it get too hot for normal daily activity as we know it, even for young, healthy adults?”</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>The answer goes beyond the temperature you see on the thermometer. It’s also about humidity. <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zsXN72cAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">Our</a> <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xuBw4jQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">research</a> is designed to come up with the combination of the two, measured as “wet-bulb temperature.” Together, heat and humidity put people at greatly increased risk, and the combination <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00738.2021"">gets dangerous at lower levels</a> than scientists previously believed.</p>

<h2>The limits of human adaptability</h2>

<p>Scientists and other observers have become alarmed about the increasing frequency of extreme heat paired with high humidity.</p>

<p>People often point to a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0913352107"">study published in 2010</a> that theorized that a wet-bulb temperature of 95 F (35 C) – equal to a temperature of 95 F at 100% humidity, or 115 F at 50% humidity – would be the upper limit of safety, beyond which the human body can no longer cool itself by evaporating sweat from the surface of the body to maintain a stable body core temperature.</p>

<p>It was not until recently that this limit was tested on humans in laboratory settings. The results of these tests show an even greater cause for concern.</p>

<h2>The PSU H.E.A.T. Project</h2>

<p>To answer the question of “how hot is too hot?” we brought young, healthy men and women into the <a href=""https://hhd.psu.edu/kines/get-started/research-labs-and-initiatives"">Noll Laboratory at Penn State University</a> to experience heat stress in a controlled environmental chamber.</p>

<p>These experiments provide insight into which combinations of temperature and humidity begin to become harmful for even the healthiest humans.</p>

<p>Each participant swallowed a small <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/topics/nasalife/thermometer_pill.html"">telemetry pill</a> that continuously monitored their deep body or core temperature. They then sat in an environmental chamber, moving just enough to simulate the minimal activities of daily living, such as showering, cooking and eating. Researchers slowly increased either the temperature in the chamber or the humidity in hundreds of separate experiments and monitored when the subject’s core temperature started to rise.</p>

<p>That combination of temperature and humidity at which the person’s core temperature starts to continuously rise is called the “<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00738.2021"">critical environmental limit</a>.” </p>

<p>Below those limits, the body is able to maintain a relatively stable core temperature over long periods of time. Above those limits, core temperature rises continuously and the risk of heat-related illnesses with prolonged exposures is increased.</p>

<p>When the body overheats, the heart has to work harder to pump blood flow to the skin to dissipate the heat, and when you’re also sweating, that decreases body fluids. In the direst case, prolonged exposure can result in heat stroke, a life-threatening problem that requires immediate and rapid cooling and medical treatment. </p>

<p>Our studies on young healthy men and women show that this upper environmental limit <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00738.2021"">is even lower</a> than the theorized 35 C. It occurs at a wet-bulb temperature of about 87 F (31 C) across a range of environments above 50% relative humidity. That would equal 87 F at 100% humidity or 100 F (38 C) at 60% humidity.</p>

<h2>Dry vs. humid environments</h2>

<p>Current heat waves around the globe are exceeding those critical environmental limits, and approaching, if not exceeding, even the theorized 95 F (35 C) wet-bulb limits.</p>

<p>In the Middle East, Asaluyeh, Iran, recorded an extremely dangerous <a href=""https://www.weather.gov/wrh/timeseries?site=OIBP&amp;hours=72"">maximum wet-bulb temperature</a> of 92.7 F (33.7 C) on <a href=""https://twitter.com/US_Stormwatch/status/1680700765265072128"">July 16, 2023</a>. <a href=""https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/at-400c-delhis-real-feel-was-above-500c-on-tuesday-573438.html"">India</a> and <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/hotter-human-body-can-handle-pakistan-city-broils-worlds-highest/"">Pakistan</a> have both reached hazardous levels in recent years, as well. </p>

<p>In hot, dry environments, the critical environmental limits aren’t defined by wet-bulb temperatures, because almost all the sweat the body produces evaporates, which cools the body. However, the amount humans can sweat is limited, and we also gain more heat from the higher air temperatures.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that these cutoffs are based solely on keeping your body temperature from rising excessively. Even lower temperatures and humidity can place stress on the heart and other body systems. </p>

<p>A recent paper from our laboratory showed that <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37348014/"">heart rate begins to increase</a> well before our core temperature does, as we pump blood to the skin. And while eclipsing these limits does not necessarily present a worst-case scenario, prolonged exposure may become dire for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases. </p>

<p>Our experimental focus has now turned to testing older men and women, since even healthy aging makes people less heat-tolerant. The increased prevalence of heart disease, respiratory problems and other health problems, as well as certain medications, can put them at even higher risk of harm. People over the age of 65 comprise some <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.87.9.1515"">80% to 90% of heat wave casualties</a>.</p>

<h2>How to stay safe</h2>

<p>Staying well hydrated and seeking areas in which to cool down – even for short periods – are important in high heat.</p>

<p>While more cities in the United States are expanding <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/docs/UseOfCoolingCenters.pdf"">cooling centers</a> to help people escape the heat, there will still be many people who will experience these dangerous conditions with <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2022-06-20/sweltering-streets-hundreds-of-homeless-die-in-extreme-heat-each-year"">no way to cool themselves</a>. </p>

          </figure>

<p>Even those with access to air conditioning might not turn it on because of the <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7124a1"">high cost of energy</a> – a common occurrence in Phoenix – or because of <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-government-and-politics-business-environment-and-nature-6a66be20ed86ad18ed131156c9f7a517"">large-scale power outages</a> during heat waves or wildfires, as is becoming more common in the western U.S.</p>

<p>All told, the evidence continues to mount that climate change is not just a problem for the future. It is one that humanity is currently facing and must tackle head-on.</p>

    <p><em>The <a href=""https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231"">Research Brief</a> is a short take about interesting academic work.</em></p>

<h2>The big idea</h2>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06331-x"">common genetic variant</a> explains why some people are asymptomatic after being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, according to our recently published study in the journal Nature.</p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, we were intrigued that many people did not develop COVID-19 symptoms while still testing positive for it. Because asymptomatic people are unlikely to seek medical help, we knew that collecting DNA samples to study the role of genetics in asymptomatic infections would be difficult. So instead, we took advantage of existing genetic data stored in the <a href=""https://bethematch.org/about-us/how-we-help-patients/be-the-match-registry/"">Be The Match</a> U.S. bone marrow donor registry. </p>

<p>We invited volunteers registered as donors to track their experience with COVID-19 via a smartphone app developed by the <a href=""https://covid19.eurekaplatform.org"">COVID-19 Citizen Science Study</a>. This allowed us to analyze the genetics of nearly 30,000 people without collecting biological samples and to identify COVID-19 positive individuals who never became sick.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>We were particularly interested in analyzing the variation of <a href=""https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap"">human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, genes</a>. These key components of the immune system encode for proteins that display the viral particles that <a href=""https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-b-cells-and-t-cells-explained-141888"">T cells</a> – a group of immune system cells critical for fighting infections – recognize. Because HLA molecules are important in the immune response to pathogens and are highly variable among people, we thought they might play a role in COVID-19.</p>

<p>We found that 1,428 unvaccinated individuals reported a positive COVID-19 test, of whom 136 reported no COVID-19 symptoms. Our analysis identified a common variant of an HLA gene <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06331-x"">called <em>HLA-B*15:01</em></a> that is associated with asymptomatic infection. This variant is present in <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2013.06.025"">about 10% of the population with European ancestry</a>. </p>

<p>We found that people carrying the variant were more than twice as likely to remain asymptomatic after being infected with COVID-19, and those carrying two copies of this variant were more than eight times more likely to not have any symptoms. </p>

<p>Next, we used cells from people with the HLA variant who donated blood several years before the pandemic to see whether they had preexisting immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19. We found that people who had never been exposed to COVID-19 had memory T cells that worked against a specific particle of the virus, enabling them to elicit a very effective immune response against COVID-19. We also found that, when bound to HLA, this viral particle looks very similar to fragments of seasonal coronaviruses recognized by T cells. </p>

<p>Our findings suggest that <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06331-x"">preexposure to seasonal cold viruses</a> allowed people with <em>HLA-B*15:01</em> to develop a very effective immune memory that helped them to quickly kill the virus before they developed symptoms. </p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>Identifying the genetic factors associated with how the disease progresses after infection provides the basis for understanding why people respond differently to the virus that causes COVID-19 as well as other viral illnesses. Focusing on asymptomatic infections also sheds light on the early stages of infection and how the immune system fights against COVID-19. </p>

<p>Most existing vaccines protect against severe COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, identifying the viral fragments that mediate asymptomatic infection, such as the one we discovered, can help develop more specific vaccines or therapies for COVID-19.</p>

<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>

<p>Although the genetic association we identified is strong, the immune system is very complex. It remains unclear what other mechanisms regulate asymptomatic infections, or why not everyone carrying this specific variant remains without symptoms.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>

<p>We want to know if the genetic variant we identified is shared by individuals from different ancestries. This will help us understand which genetic variants are important among those in these groups with asymptomatic COVID-19. We also hope to learn what makes the cross-reactive T cells in people with <em>HLA-B*15:01</em> so remarkably effective at keeping the symptoms associated with this virus at bay.</p>

<p>As comic books’ cultural impact has grown, scholars have explored how they have reflected and shaped attitudes about everything from <a href=""https://www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/P/Politics-in-the-Gutters"">politics</a> to <a href=""https://www.usni.org/press/books/comics-and-conflict"">war</a> to <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/Superheroes-and-Economics-The-Shadowy-World-of-Capes-Masks-and-Invisible/ORoark-Salkowitz/p/book/9780815367086"">economics</a> to <a href=""https://ohiostatepress.org/books/titles/9780814215272.html"">gender</a>, <a href=""https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/black-comics-9781441135285/"">race</a>, <a href=""https://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-08474-9.html"">ability</a> and <a href=""https://www.upress.state.ms.us/Books/T/The-LGBTQ-Comics-Studies-Reader"">sexuality</a>.</p>

<p>As a <a href=""https://communicationstudies.colostate.edu/people/karrin/"">scholar of gender and political culture</a>, I am interested in comic book depictions of superheroines as elected officials. My research collaborator, Ryan Greene, and I have presented analysis of political storylines in comics involving <a href=""https://www.eventeny.com/events/comiccon-2022-3116/?action=schedule-item&amp;action_ops%5bitem_id%5d=19909"">Wonder Woman and Batgirl</a> at Comic Con International. We contend that these comic book depictions aptly illustrate how sexism weakens democracy. Our examination also demonstrates why comics history is relevant to contemporary politics. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Wonder Woman for president</h2>

<p>Wonder Woman, the Amazonian princess, warrior for peace and Earth’s self-appointed defender, has long been an icon of feminist strength. She famously graced the cover of Ms. magazine’s inaugural issue in 1972, depicted as a giant superheroine rescuing an embattled world as she ran for U.S. president on a platform of “peace and justice.”</p>

<p>In 1944, however, when Wonder Woman ran for president in the pages of her own comic book, the story exhibited a surprising undercurrent of authoritarianism and sexist thinking.</p>

<p>“<a href=""https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Wonder_Woman_Vol_1_7"">Wonder Woman for President</a>,” is a flash-forward story set in the 3000s, when women head the governments of the world. Wonder Woman’s creator, <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/241159/the-secret-history-of-wonder-woman-by-jill-lepore/"">William Moulton Marston</a>, believed in women’s moral superiority and conjured a world based on gender differences, with women representing peace and justice and men symbolizing war and corruption.</p>

<p>What Marston called the “new woman’s age,” though, has the trappings of an authoritarian state. </p>

<p>“Girl troopers” guard President Arda Moore, the woman who precedes Wonder Woman’s ascent to the Oval Office. The sky is blanketed with airships spreading “a great net of friendly protection across the length and breadth of America.” Women secretaries cheerfully wear devices on their heads that compel them to type their female bosses’ dictation. Most notably, Wonder Woman’s mother, Queen Hippolyta, assures her daughter that “all men are much happier when their strong aggressive natures are controlled by a wise and loving woman!”</p>

<p>Democracy isn’t dead in the U.S., however, and Wonder Woman’s alter ego, Diana Prince, steps into the political fray in order to keep the corrupt “Man’s Party” from taking control of the government. Her victory is undermined both by young women voters whose girlish infatuation compels them to vote for the male candidate and by a ballot-stuffing scheme orchestrated by the Man’s Party.</p>

<p>Historian Philip Smith <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1525/fmh.2018.4.3.227"">describes</a> “Wonder Woman for President” as a “proto-feminist” story that reflects attitudes about gender that were progressive in their time. </p>

<p>However, our research demonstrates how the comic introduces damaging stereotypes about gender and politics that endure to this day: that <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/05/19/americans-views-of-women-as-political-leaders-differ-by-gender/"">gender differences determine people’s approach to leadership</a>; that <a href=""http://doi.org/10.1353/rap.2006.0001"">young women voters are sometimes motivated by sexual attraction</a>; and that <a href=""https://doi.org/10.14321/rhetpublaffa.20.3.0525"">when women do gain political power, they use it to dominate men</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, although Wonder Woman is cast as a defender of democracy, Marston’s story portrays democracy as weak, prone to corruption and ultimately in need of superheroic intervention in order to survive. In that respect, “Wonder Woman for President” mirrors other stories about political superheroes in comics and films <a href=""https://www.themarysue.com/dawn-of-fascists/"">that have authoritarian underpinnings</a>.</p>

<h2>Giving sexist and authoritarian politics ‘the boot’</h2>

<p>A comics narrative that has been overlooked by scholars and fans, however, illustrates how popular culture can foster healthier attitudes about politics and gender. In the 1970s, DC Comics sent Batgirl and her alter ego, Barbara Gordon, to the nation’s capital in a narrative premised on gender equity and the strength of democracy.</p>

<p>In “<a href=""https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Detective_Comics_Vol_1_422"">The Unmasking of Batgirl</a>,” Batgirl is discouraged that the crooks she sends to jail get released and commit more crimes. Disillusioned with vigilantism, she decides that the only way to effectively fight crime is to champion legislation aimed at crime prevention and prison reform. </p>

<p>Gordon launches a campaign for U.S. Congress that promises to give corrupt politicians “the boot” – a nod to Batgirl’s signature footwear – drawing support from a diverse coalition of voters. </p>

<p>Whereas Diana Prince’s constituents were exclusively white and predominantly female, Barbara Gordon activates a multiracial coalition of women and men from various walks of life. Her heroic Batgirl persona recedes into the background as Gordon deploys a more democratic superpower – persuasion – to accomplish her mission.</p>

<p>As in Diana Prince’s campaign, nefarious actors meddle in the voting, this time using intimidation to depress voter turnout. But rather than waiting for Batgirl to save the day, Gordon’s political supporters intervene to get voters to the polls, assuring her political victory in “<a href=""https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Detective_Comics_Vol_1_424"">Batgirl’s Last Case</a>.” </p>

<p>Wonder Woman’s superpowers were needed to compensate for democracy’s weaknesses, but Batgirl’s heroics prove insufficient for ensuring justice. Her faith in the people and in democracy is rewarded when citizens, working together, save the day.</p>

<h2>Telling democratic stories</h2>

<p>As another presidential campaign season approaches, it’s worth remembering that authoritarian politics don’t always announce themselves as such. </p>

<p>Sometimes, like Wonder Woman’s signature outfit, they’re draped in red, white and blue. </p>

<p>These stories have enduring appeal. “Wonder Woman for President” continues to be celebrated on <a href=""https://www.80stees.com/products/wonder-woman-for-president-dc-comics-t-shirt"">T-shirts</a>, <a href=""https://bleedingcool.com/comics/how-wonder-woman-7-from-1943-predicted-the-future-of-politics/"">fan sites</a> and in <a href=""https://mcfarlandbooks.com/product/the-ages-of-wonder-woman/"">comics scholarship</a>. And a subset of the voting public has demonstrated support for real-world authoritarian figures <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/8/13563500/joss-whedon-donald-trump-fascist-fantasy-lone-superhero"">who make heroic promises</a>.</p>

<p>Although Batgirl’s congressional tenure has largely been ignored by scholars and fans, it illustrates how even pulpy remnants of historical pop culture sometimes provide a surprisingly robust vision of gender equity and democratic strength.</p>

  <div class=""grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
    <p>The week of July 23, 2023, thousands of Rastafarians, known for their dreadlocks and for treating cannabis as a sacrament, will gather in Jamaica to <a href=""https://www.reonline.org.uk/festival_event/birthday-of-haile-selassie-i/"">celebrate the birth of Haile Selassie I, emperor of Ethiopia</a>. </p>

<p>Estimated to number between <a href=""https://www.worlddata.info/religions/rastafari.php"">700,000 and 1,000,000 globally</a>, Rastafarian communities are <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/book/595"">located on almost every continent</a> today. Their beliefs are spread through migration, reggae music, as well as print, visual and digital media.</p>

<p>The first Rastafarian communities emerged sometime around 1931 in eastern Jamaica. The first two generations of Rastafarians were <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9780814767474/becoming-rasta/"">predominantly from African-descended people</a> who belonged to working-class communities. </p>

<p>Many Christians believe that Jesus Christ was both human and divine, and will return to the Earth to reign over a righteous kingdom of his chosen people. Similarly, Rastafarians are of the view that Emperor Selassie is God, or Jah, who manifested in human form, and that they are God’s chosen people. They borrow generously from the King James Bible, <a href=""https://www.uwipress.com/9789766404093/let-us-start-with-africa/"">braiding their theology</a> around Black and African identity and culture.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Since the mid-1970s, however, <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/The-Rastafari-Movement-A-North-American-and-Caribbean-Perspective/Barnett/p/book/9781138682153"">Rastafarian views on the emperor’s divinity have varied</a>, in part because Emperor Selassie had died but also because of an influx of new adherents of varied class, racial and national backgrounds. </p>

<p>Being a Rastafarian, and having <a href=""https://education.temple.edu/about/faculty-staff/charles-a-price-tum91324"">researched and studied the faith community</a>, I’ve seen how growing diversity among them has also brought varied views on the former emperor’s divinity.</p>

<h2>God as monarch</h2>

<p>The Rastafari believe that the prophecy of the New Testament of the Bible was fulfilled when the Ethiopian nobleman King Ras Tafari Makonnen, born in the Ethiopian province of Harar in 1892, <a href=""https://www.cdamm.org/articles/rastafari"">was crowned the 225th emperor of Ethiopia on November 2, 1930</a>.</p>

<p>Rastafarians believe that the king <a href=""https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Emperor+Haile+Selassie"">traces his lineage</a> to the Old Testament’s King David of the Tribe of Judah, and to David’s son, King Solomon. The “<a href=""https://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/kn/kn000-1.htm"">Kebra Negast</a>,” a 14th-century Ethiopian literary epic, tells the story of how the Queen of Sheba visited Solomon, and together they had a son, Menelik I, during ancient times. Menelik I was Ethiopia’s first emperor. </p>

<p>King Ras Tafari assumed the name Emperor Haile Selassie I, or Might of the Holy Trinity, along with commanding titles such as the King of Kings and the Conquering Lion of Judah. </p>

<p>Rastafarians view the king’s coronation in 1930, his titles and his lineage as fulfilling a prophecy in the Book of Revelation. According to Chapter 5, a book of “seven seals” reveals events of the apocalypse many Christians believe will begin once Christ returns – but only the “Root of David,” the “Conquering Lion,” can open it, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265740442_The_Cultural_Production_of_a_Black_Messiah_Ethiopianism_and_the_Rastafari"">each revealing events between Christ’s crucifixion and return</a>. </p>

<p>The Rastafari, named for their god – King Ras Tafari – grew from a tiny community to number in the tens of thousands in Jamaica by the 1990s, as I explain in my 2022 book “<a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479888122/rastafari/"">Rastafari: The Evolution of a People and Their Identity</a>.”</p>

<h2>The travails of worshiping a Black god</h2>

<p>Many Jamaicans, especially the elites, ridiculed the Rastafari for anointing an African monarch as a deity. They sought at every turn <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479888122/rastafari/"">to prove the Rastafari ludicrous</a>. From the 1930s into the 1970s the Rastafari were scorned by their fellow Jamaicans, subjected to discrimination and violence. Many Rastafari were <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479888122/rastafari/"">imprisoned, beaten</a>, and many <a href=""https://www.uwipress.com/9789766404093/let-us-start-with-africa/"">men forcibly shaven for their beliefs</a>.</p>

<p>Things started to change in 1966 when Emperor Selassie visited Jamaica and <a href=""https://www.life.com/people/haile-selassie-in-jamaica-photos-from-a-rastafari-milestone/"">hundreds of Rastafari swarmed the Norman Manley Airport in Kingston</a> to greet the emperor. He caused a greater stir by inviting the Rastafari to join him during official state ceremonies. </p>

<p>The emperor’s visit conferred respect on the Rastafari, attracting new converts, such as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/style/1982/10/24/rita-marley-heir-to-the-reggae-kingdom/c6a105a5-f67f-4c70-8a4d-8db0d42e5285/"">Rita Marley</a>, reggae music singer and wife of reggae superstar Bob Marley. The Rastafari became paragons of Black identity, culture and history. </p>

<p>In 1975, press announcements that Emperor Selassie was dead sparked an existential crisis for the Rastafari. In a coup led by the Ethiopian politician and soldier Mengistu Haile Mariam, the emperor was <a href=""https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/K/bo22344459.html"">imprisoned and allegedly murdered</a>. </p>

<p>Some critics asserted that the Rastafari finally <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479888122/rastafari/"">had been proved foolish</a> and that their God was dead. Bob Marley rebuffed the critics in his acclaimed song, “Jah Live” (meaning God lives).</p>

          </figure>

<h2>What happens if God dies?</h2>

<p>The Rastafari responded to the announcement in several ways. Some <a href=""https://streaming-eu.mpg.de/de/institute/eth/mediathek/video/haile_selassie/HaileSelassieFilmProject_Part_II_.mp4"">denied Emperor Selassie was dead</a>, insisting that God cannot die, and no body was found to confirm the death. Years later, bones said to be those of Emperor Selassie were recovered from a pit beneath Menelik Palace in Ethiopia, but never confirmed <a href=""https://streaming-eu.mpg.de/de/institute/eth/mediathek/video/haile_selassie/HaileSelassieFilmProject_Part_I_.mp4"">to be the emperor’s</a>.  </p>

<p>Others said <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479888122/rastafari/"">only time would reveal the meaning</a> of the emperor’s disappearance, since God’s ways are beyond the ken of mortals.</p>

<p>Another view was that the emperor’s disappearance signaled the beginning of a new era on Earth, much like Christ rising from death. In the new dispensation, these followers believed, the Rastafari must act as the emperor’s anointed and must continue the traditions, knowledge and communities they have birthed. </p>

<p>Some others believed that the emperor was worthy of veneration but not as God. This had a lot to do with the <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307810153_The_many_faces_of_Rasta_Doctrinal_Diversity_within_the_Rastafari_Movement"">increasing diversity of the Rastafarians in Jamaica</a> and internationally. </p>

<p>In Jamaica, middle-class Rastafarians known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel are more likely to subscribe to this view, as are <a href=""https://www.proquest.com/openview/81909e63b12a42187d8c9d31459150f8/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1636335"">many Africans who identify as Rastafarians</a>. However, the doctrine of the Emperor as God remains predominant.</p>

<p>There are also those who continue to wonder why so many Rastafari reject the idea that the emperor is dead. As I argue in my book, claiming that the emperor still lives, without conclusive evidence, requires faith – just as it does for Christians – who believe that Jesus Christ is immortal.</p>

    <p><em>The Food and Drug Administration’s July 13, 2023, approval of the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-nonprescription-daily-oral-contraceptive"">first over-the-counter birth control pill</a>, called Opill, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/fda-approves-first-daily-over-the-counter-birth-control-pill-opill-a-pharmacist-and-public-health-expert-explain-this-new-era-in-contraception-204230"">broadens the options</a> for people seeking to prevent pregnancy. When Opill becomes available, presumably in the first quarter of 2024, it will be sold in grocery and convenience stores, in pharmacies and through online retailers.</em></p>

<p><em>The Conversation asked Sarah Lynch, a <a href=""https://www.binghamton.edu/pharmacy-and-pharmaceutical-sciences/departments/pharmacy-practice/profile.html?id=selynch"">pharmaceutical expert</a> from Binghamton University, State University of New York, to answer some of the key questions people have about the new over-the-counter contraceptive.</em></p>

<h2>1. How does Opill work to prevent pregnancy?</h2>

<p>Opill contains norgestrel, which is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone. Progesterone works in several ways to <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2022.03.022"">prevent pregnancy</a>. First, it thickens the mucus in the cervix, which makes it challenging for sperm to enter the uterus and fertilize an egg. Second, it thins the lining of the uterus, making it less hospitable for a fertilized egg to implant. And third, it can prevent ovulation, or release of the egg, in most people.</p>

<p>Opill, like many other progestin-only birth control pills, must be <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/017031s035s036lbl.pdf"">taken at the same time each day</a> to prevent pregnancy. This is because progestin has to stay at a certain level in the body in order to effectively prevent pregnancy. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>If an Opill dose is taken even three hours late, or if vomiting or diarrhea occurs within four hours of taking the dose, a person should avoid intercourse or use some form of nonhormonal contraceptive method for two days. Even though it only takes about two days for the drug to build up to an effective level, sperm can remain fertile in the female reproductive tract for <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/pregnancy/faq-20058504#"">up to five days</a> after intercourse, meaning that it is important to take this medication regularly both before and after unprotected intercourse.</p>

<p>When used exactly as instructed, Opill is <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/opill-0075mg-oral-norgestrel-tablet-information#"">98% effective</a>. This makes it the most effective contraceptive option available for use without a prescription. Opill does not prevent sexually transmitted infections, so people looking to further protect themselves should still use some sort of barrier method during intercourse. </p>

<h2>2. Is Opill safe to be sold over the counter?</h2>

<p>Prior to Opill’s approval in the United States, birth control pills were already available without a prescription in <a href=""https://freethepill.org/otc-access-world-map"">more than 100 countries</a> around the world. The same drug in Opill, norgestrel, has been used safely and effectively for birth control <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/10/25/2017-23125/determination-that-ovrette-norgestrel-tablet-0075-milligrams-was-not-withdrawn-from-sale-for-reasons"">since 1973</a>. It has been available by prescription under the brand name Ovrette.</p>

<p>In order for a drug to be sold without a prescription in the U.S., it must first be reviewed and <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/140598/download#"">approved by the Food and Drug Administration</a>. The FDA ensures that the product can meet several conditions for safe use: It must be able to be used appropriately by consumers for self-diagnosed conditions, it should not need a health practitioner for safe and effective use, and it must have a low potential for misuse and abuse. The FDA also requires that over-the-counter <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs/otc-drug-facts-label"">drug manufacturers follow specific labeling requirements</a> and include information about the drug’s use, warnings, purpose and directions. </p>

<p>Norgestrel <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2023.10825"">has been shown to be safe</a> for most women. However, it should not be used by those who currently have or have ever had breast cancer, because <a href=""https://www.cancer.gov/types/breast/breast-hormone-therapy-fact-sheet"">some breast cancers are hormone-sensitive</a> and in some cases, hormones lead to increased growth of tumors. People should also not use Opill if they are pregnant or are taking <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/017031s035s036lbl.pdf"">certain medications</a> used for seizures, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDs or pulmonary hypertension because norgestrel may not work as effectively when taken with these medications.</p>

<p>Several studies have looked at whether women can accurately evaluate their own ability to safely use birth control. The studies show that <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1136%2Fbmjgh-2019-001402"">women are accurate in their evaluations</a> and may take birth control pills for a longer period of time when compared to having a doctor evaluate and prescribe for them.</p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">Doctors still recommend speaking to a physician or pharmacist before taking Opill, once it’s available.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>3. Shouldn’t a doctor be involved in choosing birth control?</h2>

<p>Getting a prescription for any type of hormonal contraceptive product has traditionally required a medical appointment and a screening examination with a health care provider. Screenings may include pap test, pelvic examination, clinical breast examination and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Although important, leading medical organizations such as the <a href=""https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2019/10/over-the-counter-access-to-hormonal-contraception"">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> state that these screenings are not required before safely using hormonal contraception.</p>

<p>Even before the approval of Opill, people had the option to uncouple their screening examinations from prescription access. One way has been through telehealth. A 2018 review of several online telehealth platforms found that these companies are <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X18824828"">still able to screen for safe use</a> and provide safe birth control recommendations without any type of in-person examination. In addition, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fpharmacy8040176"">more than 20 states currently allow pharmacists</a> to provide prescription contraceptive based on a self-assessment questionnaire and blood pressure screening.</p>

<p>People who want to use any type of nonprescription medication should ensure that they know their medical history and what medications they take. They should carefully review the labeling information and, if they have questions, ask their pharmacist or reach out to their primary care provider. </p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">Once Opill is available over the counter, presumably in early 2024, anyone of reproductive age will be able to get it without a prescription or parental approval.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>4.Does Opill have any side effects?</h2>

<p>Some of the <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/017031s035s036lbl.pdf"">most common side effects of Opill</a> include nausea, breast tenderness, increased appetite, acne, fatigue and headaches, which are similar to the side effects of other hormonal birth control products. With most hormonal contraceptive products, these side effects diminish over time. </p>

<p>Opill does not contain estrogen, as some other hormonal birth control pills do.  Estrogen plays a role in menstrual regularity, so people who use Opill may experience more irregular vaginal bleeding. But some individuals who use Opill <a href=""https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/progestin-only-hormonal-birth-control-pill-and-injection"">may have less bleeding</a> or stop bleeding altogether while taking the pills. </p>

<p>A commonly raised concern regarding safety of hormonal birth control is the risk of blood clots, such as <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352557"">deep vein thrombosis</a> or <a href=""https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17400-pulmonary-embolism"">pulmonary embolism</a>. This risk is mainly associated with products that contain <a href=""https://health.clevelandclinic.org/yes-your-birth-control-could-make-you-more-likely-to-have-a-blood-clot/#"">estrogen in addition</a> to progestin. </p>

<p>Progestin-only pills such as Opill carry <a href=""https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/017031s035s036lbl.pdf"">no or minimal risk of blood clots</a>. However, even products that contain estrogen <a href=""https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/committee-opinion/articles/2019/10/over-the-counter-access-to-hormonal-contraception"">still have a lower risk</a> of blood clot than the risk during pregnancy or the postpartum period. </p>

<h2>5. Will OTC status truly increase accessibility to birth control?</h2>

<p>Over-the-counter availability of Opill will undoubtedly increase access to those who are looking to prevent pregnancy without access to, interest in or time to see a health care provider. </p>

<p>However, cost constraints may still be an issue with Opill. The cost is unknown at this time. The Affordable Care Act <a href=""https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/birth-control-benefits/"">currently mandates insurance coverage</a> of certain FDA-approved prescription birth control products, but it does not require coverage of nonprescription options. In May 2023, lawmakers reintroduced <a href=""https://pressley.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Affordability-is-Access-Act-2023.pdf"">legislation requiring coverage of over-the-counter options</a>, which would require that private health insurance plans cover FDA-approved over-the-counter contraceptives without a prescription. </p>

<p>Lastly, Opill represents only one type of birth control. While Opill was <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/media/167893/download"">98% effective</a> under “perfect-use” conditions in the clinical trials of the drugs, birth control pills generally have an <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3638209/"">effectiveness of between 91% to 93%</a> under “typical-use” conditions. “<a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/contraceptive-effectiveness-united-states"">Perfect use</a>” applies to using a method consistently and correctly, while “typical use” represents effectiveness among all people who use the method, including those who do not use it consistently or correctly. Effectiveness rates of contraceptives are measured in contraceptive failure. If 100 women use a birth control that is 91% effective over one year, it is estimated that nine women using that method will become pregnant over that year. </p>

<p>People looking for options that don’t need to be taken daily and as precisely, include different hormones or provide other noncontraceptive benefits will need to continue to rely on prescription products at this time.</p>

    <p><em>The <a href=""https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231"">Research Brief</a> is a short take about interesting academic work.</em></p>

<h2>The big idea</h2>

<p>The number of people living with diabetes worldwide is on pace to more than double in the next three decades, for a total of 1.3 billion people by 2050. That is one of the key findings from our <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01301-6"">study on the global burden of diabetes</a> recently published in The Lancet.</p>

<p>We analyzed and synthesized all available epidemiological data on diabetes burden – defined as health decline due to diabetes captured through the number of cases, disease severity and deaths. Our study included more than 27,000 data sources to produce estimates of diabetes prevalence, disability and deaths for 204 countries and territories from 1990 through 2021. Using a modeling tool that takes into account sociodemographic factors and obesity, we projected diabetes prevalence out to 2050. </p>

<p>We also estimated the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1186/1478-7954-1-1"">proportion of diabetes disability and death</a> attributable to specific risk factors related to obesity, diet, physical activity, environment or occupation, tobacco use and alcohol use.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>This analysis is part of the larger <a href=""https://www.healthdata.org/gbd"">Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study</a>, which has quantified health decline due to hundreds of diseases, injuries and risk factors since 1990. Thousands of health experts and researchers around the world both contribute to and use estimates from this study, which is continually updated.</p>

<p>Our team projected that every country is expected to experience an increase in diabetes cases by 2050. In the regions that are expected to be hardest hit – including North Africa and the Middle East and Pacific island nations – there are countries where as many as 1 in 5 people could be living with diabetes in 2050 if current trends continue. Among older adults in these regions, diabetes prevalence is expected to be even higher.</p>

<p>While both <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/diabetes.html"">Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes</a> are characterized by high levels of blood sugar, also known as glucose, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type2.html"">Type 2</a> is a largely preventable disease that occurs because of gradual insulin resistance and is commonly diagnosed among adults. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/type1.html"">Type 1</a>, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease where the body cannot produce insulin; it typically develops during childhood or adolescence.</p>

<p>The vast majority of new diabetes cases in the next three decades are projected to be Type 2. We expect the two primary drivers will be aging populations and increases in obesity. In 2021, obesity was the most important risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, accounting for more than half of disability and death from the disease.</p>

<p><iframe id=""4pUC7"" class=""tc-infographic-datawrapper"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4pUC7/3/"" style=""border: medium none; height: 395px;"" width=""100%"" height=""400px"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>People living with diabetes are at significantly higher risk of developing and dying from other major diseases, including <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30752-2"">ischemic heart disease and stroke,</a> and from complications such as <a href=""https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/putting-vision-loss-and-aging-focus"">vision loss</a> and foot ulcers. This compounds the stress of diabetes on health care systems, requiring more comprehensive screening and management. However, a study found that <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/s2666-7568(21)00089-1"">fewer than 1 in 10 people</a> with diabetes in low- and middle-income countries have access to comprehensive diabetes treatment.</p>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1186/s40842-016-0039-3"">an abundance of research</a>, the two primary drivers of the expected rise in diabetes cases will be aging and obesity. As people age, their bodies’ <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312806"">ability to regulate blood sugar levels changes</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, studies indicate that <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2011.10.026"">obesity rates will continue to rise</a>. No program has yet shown <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-019-0176-8"">sustainable and population-level reductions in obesity</a>. </p>

<p>To reverse this trend in obesity rates, an approach that targets both the behavioral and structural factors related to <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.20922"">maintaining a healthy diet</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2005.02.045"">getting enough physical activity</a> will be needed.</p>

<h2>What other research is being done</h2>

<p>While our study reports on diabetes trends and risk factors over time by age, sex and geography, there are other factors that offer clues to why diabetes disproportionately afflicts certain populations.</p>

<p>Research shows that there are many complex social and economic dynamics at play when it comes to trying to live a healthy lifestyle. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2012.12.005"">Low income</a>, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005710"">low education level</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(23)00119-5"">living in urban areas</a> are all associated with a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Studies also show that <a href=""https://diabetesatlas.org/atlas/indigenous-2022/"">Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects Indigenous populations</a> across the world, largely owing to colonization and resulting disruptions to their traditional ways of life.</p>

<p>The rapid increase in the number of people living with diabetes that we project in our study doesn’t have to become a reality. Understanding how these trends are tied in with how people live is the first step toward changing the course of this disease over the coming decades.</p>

  <div class=""grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
    <p>The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup <a href=""https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup"">begins on July 20, 2023, in Australia and New Zealand</a>, and the U.S. enters the soccer tournament in a <a href=""https://theathletic.com/4694555/2023/07/17/uswnt-womens-world-cup-favourites/"">familiar position: favorites</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. Women’s National Team, or USWNT, is the reigning back-to-back champion, and many pundits are <a href=""https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/2023-womens-world-cup-odds-futures-uswnt-predictions-picks-best-bets-from-proven-soccer-insider/"">expecting it</a> to make history by securing a third successive title.</p>

<p>Certainly, the team is built on solid foundations – it has a tournament history like no other, having reached the podium in all eight editions of the tournament stretching back to 1991 – and lifted the winner’s trophy four times. And it still possesses some of the game’s most recognizable and decorated players, <a href=""https://www.ussoccer.com/players/r/megan-rapinoe"">Megan Rapinoe</a> and <a href=""https://www.ussoccer.com/players/m/alex-morgan"">Alex Morgan</a> among them.</p>

<p>Yet the U.S. players are not certain to win the World Cup this time around. No USWNT has experienced more turnover between World Cups than the current squad – it will be sporting a <a href=""https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2019/10/vlatko-andonovski-named-head-coach-of-us-womens-national-team"">new head coach</a>, and the team will be missing several mainstay players because of retirement and a spate of injuries. And its form heading into the tournament <a href=""https://www.insider.com/us-womens-soccer-issues-remain-despite-germany-win-world-cup-2022-11"">has been patchy</a>.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Moreover, there are external currents that are also pushing against U.S. dominance. A <a href=""https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/news/gender-equality-highlighted-by-2023-leaders"">commitment by governing body FIFA</a> to growing the women’s game globally has contributed to nations around the world narrowing the gap with the U.S. on the pitch.</p>

<p>All of those factors should lead to a more competitive tournament in New Zealand and Australia. But having more teams challenging the U.S. is not the only yardstick for success in the women’s game.</p>

<p>As we argue in our forthcoming book, “<a href=""https://www.routledge.com/The-2023-FIFA-Womens-World-Cup-Politics-Representation-and-Management/Beissel-Postlethwaite-Grainger-Brice/p/book/9781032459035"">The 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup: Management, Politics and Representation</a>,” much more needs to be done by world soccer’s governing body to put in place institutional reforms prioritizing what is right over simply what is profitable in the women’s game. We believe that only then can it play on a level playing field.</p>

<h2>Moving the goal posts (in the right direction)</h2>

<p>Some 22 years after the <a href=""https://time.com/6289539/womens-world-cup-2023-history/"">first official FIFA Women’s World Cup</a>, the sport is witnessing <a href=""https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37633336/women-soccer-growth-unlike-other-sport-fifa-report"">dramatic growth internationally</a>. The number of women and girls participating in the sport at all levels is increasing. FIFA’s plan is to <a href=""https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/womens/womensworldcup/australia-new-zealand2023/news/gender-equality-highlighted-by-2023-leaders"">double the number of women soccer players globally to 60 million by 2026</a> and pump US$1 billion into the women’s game over a four-year period.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.fifa.com/womens-football/media-releases/fifa-sets-the-pace-with-release-of-second-study-into-elite-womens-league-and"">more and more countries are launching professional leagues</a>, including recent additions such as Colombia and Mexico. </p>

<p>Accompanying this has been <a href=""https://www.complex.com/style/a/backwoodsaltar/nike-commitment-supporting-next-generation-women-athletes"">increased sponsorship</a> of women’s <a href=""https://www.fifa.com/womens-football/media-releases/fifa-sets-the-pace-with-release-of-second-study-into-elite-womens-league-and"">clubs and leagues</a> and a growing number of lucrative sponsorship deals for top players. </p>

<p>Governing bodies and franchises are beginning to invest more in players, coaches and infrastructure, too. And it has yielded success. The past year alone has seen <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/1344057/womens-football-record-transfers/"">record-breaking player transfers</a>, <a href=""https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/womens-fa-cup-final-2023-sets-new-attendance-record-wembley/?zephr_sso_ott=Y0EKTa#:%7E:text=Overall%20record%20for%20a%20women's,the%20highest%20in%20the%20UK"">record attendance</a> at games and television viewing figures <a href=""https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-increasing-popularity-of-women-s-3940195/#:%7E:text=Viewership%20of%20the%20NWSL%20Championship,year%20increase%20in%20TV%20viewership."">hitting an all-time high</a> at both domestic and international levels. </p>

<p>This growth is not restricted to playing fields in Europe and North America. Women’s soccer <a href=""https://theconversation.com/morocco-vs-south-africa-as-womens-football-enters-a-new-era-187267"">in Africa</a>, <a href=""https://globalsportmatters.com/culture/2022/12/21/beyond-qatar-world-cup-womens-football-growing-middle-east-north-africa/"">the Middle East and Asia</a> has also benefited. For the first time, the World Cup will see 32 teams participate – up from 24 in the past two tournaments. Among the teams making their inaugural appearance will be <a href=""https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37633336/women-soccer-growth-unlike-other-sport-fifa-report"">Morocco, the Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/debutants-come-world-cup-with-surprises-up-their-sleeves-2023-07-13/"">Noting the growth in such countries</a>, U.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski commented: “The world that is catching up is Wales, is Vietnam, is Zambia, Portugal.”</p>

<p>That isn’t to say that a handful of countries led by the U.S. won’t again dominate. But even if they do, that would not negate the strides made in the women’s game since the last World Cup in 2019.</p>

<h2>Leveling the playing pitch (a little)</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, FIFA has displayed a commitment to investing, celebrating and marketing its flagship women’s tournament in ways not seen in previous editions. Prize money, team preparation cash and compensation to players’ clubs has <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/fifpro-fifa-equal-pay-ae96bd069231795a283bdc8ec86dde7b"">increased 300% over the last World Cup</a>, with the overall prize money <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/womens-world-cup-prize-money-fifa-soccer-b27cdd2346b06aff6ee78558be9f6943"">standing at $152 million</a>. Each player at the tournament will receive at least $30,000.</p>

<p>Yet the overall prize pool remains a fraction of the men’s equivalent – a gender disparity <a href=""https://twitter.com/thepfa/status/1680679071594971136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1680679071594971136%7Ctwgr%5E61e65dfe2c55121b5fcb0eec02bc04689b3233c4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2023%2F07%2F17%2Ffootball%2Faustralia-matildas-wwc-equal-pay-video-spt-intl-hnk%2Findex.html"">called out by Australia’s national women’s side</a> in a recent video message.</p>

<p></p><div data-react-class=""Tweet"" data-react-props=""{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1680679071594971136&quot;}""><div><div twdiv=""yes""></div></div></div>

<p>And crediting FIFA for progress on gender pay issues ignores how women footballers had to overcome exploitation, under-marketing and structural and institutional barriers <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/The-2023-FIFA-Womens-World-Cup-Politics-Representation-and-Management/Beissel-Postlethwaite-Grainger-Brice/p/book/9781032459035"">created in part by the game’s governing body</a> in the first place.</p>

<p>Unlike the men’s game, dozens of players taking the pitch in Australia and New Zealand are amateur or semiprofessional footballers at best. Even some of those who are professional endure <a href=""https://equalizersoccer.com/2018/12/13/womens-world-cup-platform-players-poor-working-conditions-professional-amateur/"">poor working conditions</a>, insufficient facilities and unsafe playing conditions – something that likely plays a part in the recent spate of <a href=""https://theconversation.com/female-football-players-are-at-much-higher-risk-of-career-ending-acl-injuries-the-science-on-why-198121"">ACL injuries</a> among top female players.</p>

<p>And this is to say nothing of the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/10/03/1126587851/womens-soccer-abuse-nwsl-report"">horrific and widespread cases</a> of sexual misconduct, harassment and emotional abuse documented in the women’s game. Women soccer players from Afghanistan to India to Argentina have been subjected to systemic abuse, misconduct and violence stemming in part from labor precarity and a lack of workplace protections.</p>

<p>Here, the U.S. – long the global leader in the women’s game – is not immune, as a 2022 report into the sexual misconduct, and verbal and emotional abuse by <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/10/03/1126587851/womens-soccer-abuse-nwsl-report"">coaches in the National Women’s Soccer League</a> has shown.</p>

<p>Going into the 2023 World Cup, the USWNT remains a yardstick by which other teams can be measured. The U.S. players are emblematic of the soaring popularity and commercial value of women’s soccer. But as their labor activism, quest for equal pay and push for better protection reveals, even at the elite level of the women’s game, battles remain both on and off the pitch.</p>

<p>As somebody born and raised in Sicily, I reacted to ChatGPT’s joke with disgust. But at the same time, <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0r7Syh0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">my computer scientist brain</a> began spinning around a seemingly simple question: Should ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems be allowed to be biased? </p>

<p>You might say “Of course not!” And that would be a reasonable response. But there are some researchers, like me, who argue the opposite: AI systems like ChatGPT <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.03738"">should indeed be biased</a> – but not in the way you might think.</p>

<p>Removing bias from AI is a laudable goal, but blindly eliminating biases can have unintended consequences. Instead, bias in AI <a href=""https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.602/"">can be controlled</a> to achieve a higher goal: fairness.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Uncovering bias in AI</h2>

<p>As AI is increasingly <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/"">integrated</a> <a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/"">into</a> <a href=""https://slack.com/blog/news/introducing-slack-gpt"">everyday technology</a>, many people agree that addressing bias in AI is <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-white-houses-ai-bill-of-rights-outlines-five-principles-to-make-artificial-intelligence-safer-more-transparent-and-less-discriminatory-192003"">an important issue</a>. But what does “AI bias” actually mean? </p>

<p>Computer scientists say an AI model is biased if it <a href=""https://www.airoboticslaw.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-bias-mitigating-risk"">unexpectedly produces skewed results</a>. These results could exhibit prejudice against individuals or groups, or otherwise not be in line with positive human values like fairness and truth. Even small divergences from expected behavior can have a “<a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.05842"">butterfly effect</a>,” in which seemingly minor biases can be amplified by generative AI and have far-reaching consequence.</p>

<p>Bias in generative AI systems <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.03738"">can come from a variety of sources</a>. Problematic <a href=""https://hbr.org/2019/10/what-do-we-do-about-the-biases-in-ai"">training data</a> can <a href=""https://theconversation.com/ageism-sexism-classism-and-more-7-examples-of-bias-in-ai-generated-images-208748"">associate certain occupations with specific genders</a> or <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-generative-ai-bias/"">perpetuate racial biases</a>. Learning algorithms themselves <a href=""https://www.engati.com/glossary/algorithmic-bias"">can be biased</a> and then amplify existing biases in the data.</p>

<p></p><div data-react-class=""Tweet"" data-react-props=""{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1667143605801156611&quot;}""><div><div twdiv=""yes""></div></div></div>

<p>But systems <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.03738"">could also be biased by design</a>. For example, a company might design its generative AI system to prioritize formal over creative writing, or to specifically serve government industries, thus inadvertently reinforcing existing biases and excluding different views. Other societal factors, like a lack of regulations or misaligned financial incentives, can also lead to AI biases. </p>

<h2>The challenges of removing bias</h2>

<p>It’s not clear whether bias can – or even should – be entirely eliminated from AI systems.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re an AI engineer and you notice your model produces a stereotypical response, like Sicilians being “stinky.” You might think that the solution is to remove some bad examples in the training data, maybe jokes about the smell of Sicilian food. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.03819"">Recent research</a> has identified how to perform this kind of “AI neurosurgery” to deemphasize associations between certain concepts.</p>

<p>But these well-intentioned changes can have unpredictable, and possibly negative, effects. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.01910"">Even small variations</a> in the training data or in an AI model configuration can lead to significantly different system outcomes, and these changes are impossible to predict in advance. You don’t know what other associations your AI system has learned as a consequence of “unlearning” the bias you just addressed.</p>

<p>Other attempts at bias mitigation run similar risks. An AI system that is trained to completely avoid certain sensitive topics could <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.04359"">produce incomplete or misleading responses</a>. Misguided regulations can worsen, rather than improve, issues of AI bias and safety. <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesbroughel/2023/06/22/how-regulating-ai-could-empower-bad-actors/"">Bad actors</a> could evade safeguards to elicit malicious AI behaviors – making <a href=""https://theconversation.com/four-ways-criminals-could-use-ai-to-target-more-victims-207944"">phishing scams more convincing</a> or <a href=""https://theconversation.com/events-that-never-happened-could-influence-the-2024-presidential-election-a-cybersecurity-researcher-explains-situation-deepfakes-206034"">using deepfakes to manipulate elections</a>.</p>

<p>With these challenges in mind, researchers are working to improve data sampling techniques and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i6.25911"">algorithmic fairness</a>, especially <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/2090236.2090255"">in settings</a> where <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3340531.3411980"">certain sensitive data</a> is not available. Some companies, <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/21/1068893/how-openai-is-trying-to-make-chatgpt-safer-and-less-biased/"">like OpenAI</a>, have opted to have <a href=""https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/"">human workers annotate the data</a>.</p>

<p>On the one hand, these strategies can help the model better align with human values. However, by implementing any of these approaches, developers also run the risk of introducing new cultural, ideological or political biases.</p>

<h2>Controlling biases</h2>

<p>There’s a trade-off between reducing bias and making sure that the AI system is still useful and accurate. Some researchers, including me, think that generative AI systems should be allowed to be biased – but in a carefully controlled way.</p>

<p>For example, my collaborators and I developed techniques that <a href=""https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.602/"">let users specify</a> what level of bias an AI system should tolerate. This model can detect toxicity in written text by accounting for in-group or cultural linguistic norms. While traditional approaches can inaccurately flag some posts or comments written in <a href=""https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/P19-1163"">African-American English as offensive</a> and by <a href=""https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.507/"">LGBTQ+ communities as toxic</a>, this “controllable” AI model provides a much fairer classification.</p>

<p>Controllable – and safe – generative AI is important to ensure that AI models produce outputs that align with human values, while still allowing for nuance and flexibility.</p>

<h2>Toward fairness</h2>

<p>Even if researchers could achieve bias-free generative AI, that would be just one step toward the <a href=""https://theconversation.com/what-is-ethical-ai-and-how-can-companies-achieve-it-204349"">broader goal of fairness</a>. The pursuit of fairness in generative AI requires a holistic approach – not only better data processing, annotation and debiasing algorithms, but also human collaboration among developers, users and affected communities.</p>

<p>As AI technology continues to proliferate, it’s important to remember that bias removal is not a one-time fix. Rather, it’s an ongoing process that demands constant monitoring, refinement and adaptation. Although developers might be unable to easily anticipate or contain the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.05842"">butterfly effect</a>, they can continue to be vigilant and thoughtful in their approach to AI bias.</p>

    <p>Back-to-school sales are underway, and people across the country will be shopping online to fill up backpacks, lockers and closets – and they’ll be taking advantage of free returns.</p>

<p>Making it easy for customers to return items at no cost started as a retail strategy to <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/free-online-shopping-returns-retailer-policy-changes/673975/"">entice more people to shop online</a>. But it’s getting expensive, for <a href=""https://theconversation.com/inside-the-black-box-of-amazon-returns-206551"">both retailers and the planet</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, retail returns added up to more than <a href=""https://nrf.com/research/2022-consumer-returns-retail-industry"">US$800 billion in lost sales</a>. The <a href=""https://theconversation.com/inside-the-black-box-of-amazon-returns-206551"">transportation, labor, and logistics</a> involved raised retailers’ costs even higher. Product returns also increase pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and waste in landfills, where many returned products now end up.</p>

<p>So how can retailers fix this problem and still provide quality customer service?</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bqBiAJQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">We conduct</a> <a href=""https://www.ivybusiness.iastate.edu/directory/cfaires/"">research</a> in reverse logistics, focusing primarily on the intersection of retail returns and customer behavior. Here are some insights that can help <a href=""https://www.retailtouchpoints.com/topics/customer-experience/how-retailers-can-minimize-returns-focus-on-convenience-communication-and-personalization"">reduce the abuse of free returns</a> and lower costs without losing quality.</p>

<p><iframe id=""V7yOA"" class=""tc-infographic-datawrapper"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/V7yOA/1/"" style=""border: none"" width=""100%"" height=""400px"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>

<h2>Nudging: In-store vs. shipped returns</h2>

<p>Where a product is returned makes a difference. Items returned to the store can be restocked an average of 12 to 16 days faster than those that are mailed. Mailed returns also cost companies more: The difference between the most expensive shipped returns and least expensive in-store returns is <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/returning-to-order-improving-returns-management-for-apparel-companies"">$5 to $6</a> per item. That adds up quickly.</p>

<p>Studies show that customers may be willing to change their return behavior – <a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3890170-moving-the-needle-on-supply-chain-sustainability/"">with a little help</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2023/02/23/how-brands-can-nudge-consumers-positive-behavior-change-sustainability"">Behavioral nudges</a> are a technique used in decision-making to steer a person toward a specific behavior. Putting candy at eye-level at the grocery store checkout counter to encourage impulse purchases is an example, or making employee participation in a <a href=""https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-behavioral-economics#nudge"">401(k) savings program the default</a> option. Another type of nudge involves <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeem.2018.06.009"">providing more information</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever shopped online and seen statements like “10 out of 10 customers recommend this product” or “Only 2 items left in stock,” you have experienced the use of information to influence your decision. Nudges emphasizing sustainability may also appeal to customers and have a positive impact on return behavior.</p>

<p>In a recent survey, 94% of merchants said customers were concerned about sustainability, according to a <a href=""https://happyreturns.com/merchant-survey-2023"">report from Happy Returns</a>, a logistics firm that works with retailers.</p>

<p>However, a much lower percentage of customers actually make sustainable return decisions. That suggests that customers do not fully understand the environmental impact of their return choices – and it offers a way for retailers to help.</p>

<p>Our research found that when customers were given information about the environmental impact of the different return options, they were nearly 17 times more likely to choose an in-store return rather than returning an item by mail. Nudges like this offer a simple and inexpensive way for retailers to alter customer behavior in favor of sustainability.</p>

<h2>Picking up returns to speed up the process</h2>

<p>Some customers request to return an item but then wait weeks before mailing it. It’s known as customer procrastination, and it also has a cost. The longer these products remain unprocessed, <a href=""https://wwd.com/business-news/business-features/innovation-in-online-returns-why-online-merchants-are-embracing-box-free-returns-as-the-new-default-return-method-1235197019/"">the more value they can lose</a>.</p>

<p>High-priced electronics, such as laptops and tablets, have short product life cycles and lose value quickly, sometimes at a rate of 1% per week. Seasonal items, such as back-to-school supplies or winter coats, become more difficult to resell if retailers get them back on shelves after demand has bottomed out. A returned item’s resale value <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-stores-do-with-90-billion-in-merchandise-returns-1518777000"">determines its destination</a>: It can end up back on store shelves, sold to liquidators for pennies on the dollar or sent to a landfill.</p>

<p>A home pickup service for time-sensitive returns could reduce delays in a way that is also useful to the customer. A small number of pickup vehicles collecting returns from customers could avoid multiple shipments, <a href=""https://chainstoreage.com/survey-returns-cost-online-retailers-21-order-value"">reducing total miles traveled</a> and cutting vehicle emissions, while also avoiding the need for each return to be individually packaged.</p>

<p>Our research found that a pickup service could help retailers collect returns faster and reduce product value loss, particularly for high-priced products and products that lose value quickly, such as consumer electronics.</p>

<h2>How to change policies without losing customers</h2>

<p>While several retailers have <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/free-online-shopping-returns-retailer-policy-changes/673975/"">stopped offering free returns</a> or changed their return policies over the past year, our research suggests that changes affecting all customers might not be the best choice.</p>

<p>Broad policy changes that affect everyone might involve limiting the number of returns per customer, charging a fee for returns or shortening the window for returns. An alternative is a targeted return policy that applies only to people who abuse the system. For example, retailers can restrict free returns for people who repeatedly buy more items than they intend to keep, knowing they can return the rest.</p>

<p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.07.011"">We conducted two studies</a> to explore how customers would view changes to a retailer’s return policies.</p>

<p>In the first study, 460 participants were significantly more likely to speak negatively about the retailer – a fictitious company, in this case – when the retailer’s returns policy change applied to everyone and affected everyone equally.</p>

<p>Our follow-up study asked 100 online customers about their thoughts regarding generalized versus targeted policy changes. When the return policy change targeted customers who abused returns, 44% of the participants expressed positive emotions, and only 13% expressed negative emotions.</p>

<p>Those positive emotions included comments like, “I would feel proud of the company for taking action against people who try to cheat the system.” Such responses indicated that participants understood that cheaters were increasing the price paid by everyone. </p>

<p>But when the return policy change applied to everyone, 64% of the participants expressed negative emotions. Nearly half indicated they would speak negatively about the policy change to family and friends, and 42% said they would shop at another store.</p>

<h2>Other ways to help customers make better decisions</h2>

<p>Retailers can also change the online shopping experience before the customer makes a purchase <a href=""https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/6-creative-ways-retailers-prevent-returns"">to avoid the need for returns</a>.</p>

<p>One way is to obtain detailed <a href=""https://www.zenstores.com/tutorials/prevent-returns-your-online-shop/"">customer feedback</a> on returns and use that to provide better product descriptions to customers. Another is to avoid incentivizing the wrong behavior. Well-intentioned <a href=""https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/6-creative-ways-retailers-prevent-returns"">free shipping on orders over a set dollar amount</a> could encourage customers to overpurchase and later return products.</p>

<p>Posting videos of items for sale can help buyers spot problems that photos might hide. <a href=""https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2023/04/13/virtual-fitting-rooms"">Virtual fitting rooms</a> that use an avatar of the customer to try on clothes virtually can help customers choose the right size the first time.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that managing retail returns is a <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/returning-to-order-improving-returns-management-for-apparel-companies"">difficult task</a>. To make the process more sustainable, retailers need to help customers make choices that limit the need for a return or that minimize the impact of a return on the environment and, of course, the retailer’s bottom line.</p>

    <p>The song “Be Healthy” from the 2000 album by hip-hop duo dead prez, “<a href=""https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dead-prez-lets-get-free/"">Let’s Get Free</a>,” is a rare rap anthem dedicated to diet, exercise and temperance:</p>

<p><em>“They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy / My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy / ‘Cause true wealth come from good health and wise ways / We got to start taking better care of ourselves”</em> </p>

<p>In what’s widely recognized as <a href=""https://www.grammy.com/news/2023-grammys-celebrate-50-years-hip-hop-star-performance-segment"">hip-hop’s 50th anniversary</a>, an unfortunate reality is that several of its pioneering artists aren’t here to celebrate. The number of rappers who never live to see much more than 50 years themselves is astounding.</p>

<p>Rappers and rap fans can’t help but take notice that their peers and favorite rappers are dying young. Trugoy the Dove of De La Soul, 53, <a href=""https://www.vulture.com/2023/02/de-la-soul-trugoy-the-dove-dead-at-54.html"">passed away in February 2023</a> after a <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/trugoy-the-dove-member-of-hip-hop-trio-de-la-soul-dies-at-54"">battle with congestive heart failure</a>. Gangsta Boo, hailed as the “<a href=""https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/01/14/gangsta-boo-celebration-of-life-memphis-rap-railgarten/69804248007/"">Queen of Memphis</a>” and known for her work with Three 6 Mafia, <a href=""https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/gangsta-boo-dead-former-three-6-mafia-rapper-dies-obituary-1235192876/"">died at the age of 43</a> of a drug overdose in January 2023. Takeoff, a member of the Atlanta trio Migos, was <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/arts/music/takeoff-migos-dead.html"">killed in November 2022</a>. He was 28 years old. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Rapper <a href=""https://www.vibe.com/news/entertainment/jim-jones-stands-on-rappers-have-the-most-dangerous-job-comment-1234672569/"">Jim Jones has claimed</a> that rap is the most dangerous profession due to rappers <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/takeoff-death-hip-hop-rap-violence/672117/"">being violently killed so frequently</a>. Similarly, <a href=""https://www.complex.com/music/a/backwoodsaltar/fat-joe-rappers-endangeed-species-pnb-rock-death"">rapper Fat Joe believes</a> rappers are an endangered species. In the 2022 song “On Faux Nem,” Lupe Fiasco put it more succinctly: “Rappers die too much.”</p>

<p>As a rapper, a fan of hip-hop’s art and artists, and a <a href=""https://news.virginia.edu/content/meet-ad-carson-uvas-professor-hip-hop"">professor of hip-hop</a>, I agree with Lupe Fiasco: Rappers die too much. Whether it’s from gun violence, heart disease, cancer, self-harm or drugs, the number of rappers whose lives have ended prematurely is alarming.</p>

<h2>The (un)exceptional spectacle of American gun violence</h2>

<p>Stories of rappers who die violently are well known. News media are quick to report on <a href=""https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/11/01/gun-violence-has-killed-at-least-1-rapper-every-year-since-2018-2/"">violence in hip-hop</a> to <a href=""https://theconversation.com/scapegoating-rap-hits-new-low-after-july-fourth-mass-shooting-186443"">support their view</a> that the music and the people who make it are exceptionally violent. Violence, death and conflict attract attention. Pair any of those with racial stereotyping and scapegoating and it’s easy to see why the murders of hip-hop stars such as Nipsey Hussle, the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur and countless other artists garner so much attention.</p>

<p>Though they were all taken by the <a href=""https://theconversation.com/rappers-are-victims-of-an-epidemic-of-gun-violence-just-like-all-of-america-194429"">very American plague of gun violence</a>, news and historical accounts often amplify the spectacle of violent Black death, even when they claim to honor those who are killed. </p>

<p>I’ve <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2021/05/24/173838383/a-letter-to-my-mother-just-in-case"">written extensively</a> about the trend of scapegoating rappers. It is also the topic addressed in the song “<a href=""https://aydeethegreat.bandcamp.com/track/ankh-featuring-nathaniel-star"">ANKH</a>” from my forthcoming mixtap/e/ssay, “<a href=""https://aydeethegreat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Illicit-Press-Release-6-23-pdf-232x300.jpg"">V: ILLICIT</a>”:</p>

<p><em>“He died by the gun but they blamed the music. / They said, ‘What he said was evidence.’ And used it. …/ No compassion for the life torn apart when the bullets hit him, / cause he talked about the block in his art, so he’s not a victim. / Cameraman said, ‘They don’t value life too much.’ / He reported here before. Even twice some months. / Somewhere in his mid-twenties was his deadline (dying). / ‘Another N— Killed Here’ was the headline (crying).”</em></p>

<iframe style=""border: 0; width: 350px; height: 442px;"" src=""https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=594009146/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=de270f/tracklist=false/transparent=true/"" seamless="""" width=""100%"" height=""400""><a href=""https://aydeethegreat.bandcamp.com/track/ankh-featuring-nathaniel-star"">ANKH (featuring Nathaniel Star) by A.D. Carson</a></iframe>

<p>An awful byproduct of this culture of consuming carnage is that the kinds of violent gun tragedies people are experiencing <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2022/gun-deaths-per-year-usa/"">all across the U.S.</a> are being spotlighted in hip-hop and used as <a href=""https://theconversation.com/scapegoating-rap-hits-new-low-after-july-fourth-mass-shooting-186443"">excuses to criminalize and pathologize</a> certain people and the music they enjoy, the art they create, the neighborhoods they live in or the places they grew up.</p>

<p>Another heartbreaking consequence is that some rappers only gain wide popularity and realize financial success <a href=""https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/23/posthumous-albums-by-young-rappers-are-topping-the-charts"">after they’ve died</a>. Deceased rappers are an unfortunately abundant commodity. Juice WRLD and Pop Smoke are prime examples: They both sold four to five times as much music after their deaths than when they were alive.</p>

<p>Along with being alarmed by these tragedies, it’s important to examine the conditions that affect mortality and attempt to get to the actual causes rather than scapegoating a musical form.</p>

<h2>Deadly diseases</h2>

<p>While violence brings about headlines, guns are not the only cause for concern. Diseases – many of them preventable – are also a factor.</p>

<p>Heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes, strokes and renal disease are among the top 10 causes of death <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/lcod/men/2017/nonhispanic-black/index.htm"">among Black men</a> and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/lcod/men/2018/byrace-hispanic/index.htm"">Hispanic men</a>, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It makes sense that these causes also prominently figure in the deaths of hip-hop artists. </p>

<h2>A renewed focus on health</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this list of tragic lives halted from ages 21 to 57 is not a comprehensive account of all the rappers who have passed away well before the age of retirement.</p>

<p>The occasion of celebrating 50 years of hip-hop provides a moment to reflect and honor some of the artists who contributed to the culture and are not here to celebrate this golden anniversary. It’s also, perhaps, an opportunity to consider some of the outcomes of systemic barriers to health and wellness, such as <a href=""https://health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health/literature-summaries/access-health-services"">access to affordable health care</a>, varied dietary options and mental wellness resources.</p>

<p>Given the number of rappers and other prominent hip-hop artists who have died young, ultimately it may come down to seriously taking heed to dead prez’s instructions from “Be Healthy”: “We got to start taking better care of ourselves.”</p>

<h2>1. Target letters are warnings</h2>

<p>The Department of Justice’s general practice is to warn people being investigated for complex crimes that they are about to be charged with crimes. This is done through an official correspondence known as a “<a href=""https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-160-sample-target-letter"">target letter</a>.” </p>

<p>There are two types of target letters:</p>

<p>The first is a document issued by federal prosecutors to a person who has been <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.151"">subpoenaed to testify</a> before a grand jury as a witness and who is likely to be charged with a crime related to that testimony. The second is issued when a person has not been subpoenaed as a witness but is <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.153"">nevertheless likely to be indicted</a> by a grand jury. In such cases, <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/usao/justice-101/charging"">Justice Department policy</a> is to notify the person of an impending indictment.</p>

<p>It is not clear which type  of letter Trump received, but it is reasonable to speculate that it is the latter. </p>

<p>The grand jury called by <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/08/us/politics/jack-smith-special-counsel-trump-indictment.html"">Special Prosecutor Jack Smith</a> is not known to have subpoenaed Trump in this investigation of the Capitol attack. The Justice Department is unlikely to have subpoenaed Trump to testify, given that he is unlikely to waive his privilege against self-incrimination. </p>

<p>Target letters also give the potential defendant an opportunity to decide how to respond. If the target does not have legal counsel, the letter gives them a strong indication that they should get a lawyer. Since target letters come before someone is charged with a crime, the person would not normally have the constitutional right to be appointed counsel at this time. </p>

<h2>2. Target letters can help the prosecution</h2>

<p>Target letters can serve the prosecution’s interests. They can help ensure that any testimony given to the grand jury will later be admissible or able to be used in court.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has never expressly decided whether grand jury witnesses are entitled to <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/miranda_warning"">Miranda-like warnings</a>, meaning a person should be informed of their rights to remain silent or consult with an attorney before they speak or during their testimony. However, <a href=""https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/237373/united-states-v-patrick-j-scully/"">since at least the 1950s</a>, lower courts have indicated that the better practice is to warn witnesses and targets that testifying before a grand jury creates legal risks.</p>

<p>Prosecutors want to avoid unnecessary litigation, as well as the appearance that they are possibly taking advantage of witnesses. So the Justice Department uses target letters as an opportunity to advise witnesses that they have the right to obtain counsel, to decline to answer incriminating questions and that any testimony may later be used against them. </p>

<h2>3. Target letters can be useful, but are not necessary</h2>

<p>The Supreme Court has held that the <a href=""https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/431/181/"">Constitution does not require</a> that an individual who is properly warned of their privilege against self-incrimination also be told that they are a target of the grand jury’s investigation. But Justice Department policy requires that target letters be issued in every case where a target is subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury. </p>

<p>The Justice Department has decided to give Trump this additional warning anyway. Advising an individual that they are a target might induce cooperation, and it promotes the appearance of fairness.</p>

    <p>With the news on July 18, 2023, that Special Counsel Jack Smith had informed former <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/18/us/trump-jan-6-letter"">President Donald Trump that he was a target</a> of the federal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the related Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, speculation began immediately among political analysts and pundits about what charges the former president might face. </p>

<p>But criminal investigations are not public, so drawing conclusions about what charges Smith might bring would have to rely on indications from other sources. </p>

<p>One place to find some possible hints: Smith’s investigation into Trump came on the heels of the sprawling public investigation of the Capitol insurrection by the <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/committee/house-january6th"">House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack</a>, known colloquially as the House January 6 committee. </p>

<p>The committee interviewed 1,200 people, including former Trump staff, state election officials and people who had participated in the Jan. 6 attack. Its <a href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report"">final report</a> was <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/12/23/1145160544/jan-6-report-committee-donald-trump"">845 pages long</a> and provided many previously unknown facts and details about what happened on Jan. 6 and in the days and weeks leading up to it. The committee <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/january-6-final-hearing-investigation-wraps-0bceb95826c1c836023d2810ccbeccca"">recommended Trump be charged</a> with conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to make a false statement and aiding an insurrection. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Here are four of The Conversation’s stories about the committee’s work to help you understand what it did, what it found and how its work may fit into what could be yet another historic prosecution of a former U.S. president. Three of the four were written by <a href=""https://theconversation.com/profiles/claire-leavitt-1351188"">Claire Leavitt</a>, a Smith College scholar of congressional oversight whose analyses are grounded in real-world experience: She spent a year working on the Democratic majority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.</p>

<h2>1. What’s an investigation and what’s a hearing?</h2>

<p>As the committee prepared for its first public hearing, Leavitt laid out its two-pronged functions: investigation first, public hearings second. </p>

<p>“<a href=""https://theconversation.com/how-a-public-hearing-is-different-from-an-investigation-and-what-that-means-for-the-jan-6-committee-184342"">Blockbuster hearings are fascinating and even fun</a>,” wrote Leavitt. “They dominate the political and cultural conversation and prompt movie stars to show up in ‘Saturday Night Live’ cold opens. But what do they actually accomplish?”</p>

<p>Such high-profile hearings, wrote Leavitt, actually represent the end of the investigative process. They “tend to be choreographed affairs, presenting a tightly woven narrative to the public. By now, most of the investigative work has already been done.”</p>

<p>Hearings “establish a shared foundation of facts that can inform short- and long-term debates – around the dinner table, in the media, in Congress and among scholars – over how major events should be interpreted,” wrote Leavitt. And they can also serve as a “a kind of preemptive justification for specific legal and legislative actions that may follow the investigation.”</p>

<p>For example, Leavitt wrote, “if the committee does end up recommending criminal charges against Trump and his allies, the hearings have already explained the legitimacy of these charges to the public.”</p>

<h2>2. Historic event given time-tested congressional scrutiny</h2>

<p>Leavitt also set the January 6 committee’s work – really, its very existence – in historical context. For all the complaints by Trump and his allies that the investigation was illegitimate and a “<a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-responded-jan-6-committee/story?id=95323334"">witch hunt</a>,” Leavitt wrote that the committee’s work <a href=""https://theconversation.com/jan-6-committee-tackled-unprecedented-attack-with-time-tested-inquiry-195999"">fit squarely into the U.S. democratic tradition</a>.</p>

<p>“The committee’s recommendation to prosecute a former president was unprecedented. But its investigation of the events of Jan. 6, 2021, fell squarely within Congress’ power and added a new chapter to a centurieslong history of congressional investigations into government scandals and failures,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Congress has the power to investigate. “Its standing and special committees,” wrote Leavitt, “known as select committees, regularly conduct both preemptive oversight and retroactive investigations. Their aim: to identify specific cases of wrongdoing both inside and outside government.” </p>

<p>And it’s the committee’s identification of wrongdoing that could have provided fodder for Jack Smith’s investigation of Trump.</p>

<h2>3. Legitimizing the drive for accountability</h2>

<p>Did the January 6 committee pave the way for Jack Smith to charge Trump in connection with the events to overturn the election?</p>

<p>With its decision to recommend charges against Trump, the January 6 committee members, wrote Santa Clara University legal scholar <a href=""https://law.scu.edu/faculty/profile/russell-margaret/"">Margaret Russell</a>, had “reached the brink. This bipartisan committee, which comprised seven Democrats and two Republicans, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/what-the-criminal-referral-of-trump-means-a-constitutional-law-expert-explains-the-jan-6-committee-action-196841"">decided unanimously</a> that backing away from criminal charges would be a dereliction of its duty to recommend, based on what it has found.”</p>

<p>The magnitude of the charges the committee recommended, “particularly the insurrection one, is unprecedented,” wrote Russell. </p>

<p>And while the committee itself could not force charges to be brought, Russell said their recommendation had “very strong teeth in the sense of urging the Department of Justice to make sure that there is accountability.” </p>

<h2>4. History takes time</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether the House January 6 committee’s work contributed to Special Counsel Jack Smith’s investigation, its work should be seen as historic, wrote Leavitt. But that will take time to become clear. </p>

<p>“<a href=""https://theconversation.com/jan-6-committees-fact-finding-and-bipartisanship-will-lead-to-an-impact-in-coming-decades-if-not-tomorrow-192324"">Assessing the full impact of the investigation</a> requires patience – probably decades’ worth,” Leavitt wrote. </p>

<p>“The process by which events become part of the public consciousness is slow and often imperceptible, but it is a legacy arguably as important as the discrete electoral or policy outcomes that emerge – or not – in the short term.”</p>

    <p>On July 19, 1848, nearly 300 men and women gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, to begin the United States’ first public political meeting regarding women’s rights. The Seneca Falls Convention resulted in the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/declaration-of-sentiments.htm"">Declaration of Sentiments</a>, a document modeled on the U.S. Declaration of Independence that asserted “all men and women are created equal.” </p>

<p>The two-day conference marked the beginning of the movement for women’s suffrage, which would be granted 70 years later by the ratification of the 19th Amendment of the Constitution. And it likely wouldn’t have happened without Quakers.</p>

<p>Four of the convention’s five leaders belonged to this Protestant Christian group, also known as the Religious Society of Friends, whose ideas and community deeply shaped the meeting. One of Quakers’ core beliefs is that all men and women possess <a href=""https://quaker.org/the-inner-light/"">the “inward light</a>” – the light of Christ – and are therefore equal in the eyes of God. This belief led Quakers to recognize women as spiritual leaders, distinguishing them from many other religious groups at the time. </p>

<p>The Quaker women who participated in the gathering at Seneca Falls had been nurtured in a religious community that <a href=""https://history.rutgers.edu/people/details/60-faculty-emeriti/162-hewitt-nancy"">historian Nancy Hewitt</a> describes as a “<a href=""https://uncpress.org/book/9781469668727/radical-friend/"">rich female world of faith, family, and friendship</a>” – one that led many of them to step into the public sphere and work for social reforms. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>As a scholar of <a href=""https://museumstudies.artsandsciences.baylor.edu/person/dr-julie-holcomb"">19th century Quaker history</a>, I have found the faith’s women at the forefront of efforts <a href=""https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501748493/moral-commerce/"">to abolish slavery</a>, promote the temperance movement and grant rights to women.</p>

<h2>Women’s souls and service</h2>

<p>Quakerism developed in the 1640s, amid the English Civil War – a time of political and religious turmoil. George Fox, <a href=""https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/walvin-quakers.html"">one of the faith’s founders</a>, spent much of the decade in spiritual wanderings, which led him to conclude the answers he sought came from his direct experience of God. As Quaker historian and theologian <a href=""https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/tr/dandelion-ben.aspx"">Ben Pink Dandelion</a> notes, “This intimacy with Christ, this relationship of direct revelation,” <a href=""https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/an-introduction-to-quakerism-pink-dandelion/3952779?ean=9780521600880"">has defined Quakerism</a> ever since.</p>

<p>The belief in the “inward light” led Fox and others to encourage women’s spiritual leadership. In <a href=""https://www.ccel.org/ccel/fox_g/autobio.vi.html#fna_vi-p56.1"">Fox’s later writings</a>, he recalled encountering a religious group who believed women had no souls, “no more than a goose.” Fox objected, reminding them of <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201%3A46-55&amp;version=KJV"">Mary’s words in the Bible</a> after an angel tells her that she will give birth to God’s son: “My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.” </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.qhpress.org/texts/fell.html"">Margaret Fell</a>, the wife of a wealthy and prominent judge, helped Fox organize his followers into the Society of Friends. Worship meetings took inspiration from the Bible’s <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A20&amp;version=KJV"">Book of Matthew</a>: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” Quakers worshipped in silence. On occasion, when a worshipper felt moved by the spirit of Christ, they would break the silence to share something with the rest.</p>

<p>Quakers also established <a href=""https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/an-introduction-to-quakerism-pink-dandelion/3952779?ean=9780521600880"">meetings to oversee church business</a>, such as approving marriages, recording births and deaths, and enforcing the faith’s discipline.</p>

<h2>Spreading the faith</h2>

<p>Quaker men and women sometimes met together, and sometimes in separate meetings. Fox believed women might be reluctant to speak up in the company of men, even though they were men’s spiritual equals. </p>

<p><a href=""https://nha.org/research/nantucket-history/history-topics/nantucket-women-how-the-quakers-womens-meetings-established-the-foundation-for-the-national-womens-rights-movement/"">In their business meetings</a>, Quaker women oversaw relief for the poor, appointed committees to visit women who had strayed from church teachings, and testified on spiritual and social concerns. One woman was selected to serve as a clerk, taking notes on members’ concerns and decisions.</p>

<p>Quakerism attracted a significant number of female converts, some of whom took an active role in spreading the faith. Eleven of the so-called “<a href=""https://pendlehill.org/product/george-fox-and-the-valiant-sixty/"">valiant sixty</a>” – itinerant ministers who preached Quaker principles in several countries – were women. <a href=""https://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/223/Elizabeth-Hooton"">Elizabeth Hooton</a>, long reputed to be Fox’s first convert, traveled widely in Britain, North America and the Caribbean, preaching and proselytizing. <a href=""https://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/187/Mary-Fisher"">Mary Fisher</a> joined six other Quakers on a spiritual visit to the Ottoman Empire in 1658, where she reported meeting with Sultan Mehmed IV. </p>

<p>Women also produced some of the <a href=""https://global.oup.com/academic/product/new-critical-studies-on-early-quaker-women-1650-1800-9780198814221?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;#:%7E:text=and%20Catie%20Gill-,Description,as%20a%20transatlantic%20religious%20body."">earliest texts of Quaker witness</a>, writing about their relationship to God. In 1666, Fell penned <a href=""http://www.qhpress.org/texts/fell.html"">the pamphlet “Women’s Speaking Justified</a>,” a scripture-based argument for the spiritual equality of the sexes. Her text is now recognized as a major 17th century document on women’s religious leadership.</p>

<h2>Acting on faith</h2>

<p>The Quaker women who organized the Seneca Falls Convention were born into this world of female ministry. For women like Philadelphia Quaker <a href=""https://www.pennpress.org/9780812222791/lucretia-motts-heresy/"">Lucretia Mott</a>, one of the Seneca Falls Convention’s organizers, Quaker practice normalized the idea that women, too, should have education, religious authority and the right to speak freely. Mott was also active in the antislavery movement, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/how-18th-century-quakers-led-a-boycott-of-sugar-to-protest-against-slavery-174114"">boycotting slave-labor goods</a> such as cotton and sugar and organizing women in associations like the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. </p>

<p>Indeed, Quakers’ commitment to equality and community led many men and women to become social activists – but not without controversy. In the 1820s and again in the 1840s, the Society of Friends experienced a series of divisions over Quakers’ involvement in the antislavery movement and other reforms. Some saw activism as a natural manifestation of Quaker beliefs, but others feared that it threatened the group’s spiritual unity.</p>

<p>In 1848 – the same year as the Seneca Falls Convention – 200 Quakers made the decision to break from their yearly meeting, their local association. Citing their “<a href=""https://www.pennpress.org/9780812222791/lucretia-motts-heresy/"">rights of conscience</a>,” these men and women later formed the Yearly Meeting of Congregational Friends. Congregational Friends believed their faith required them to take steps toward abolishing slavery, and many also felt compelled to seek rights for women.</p>

<h2>‘Simply human rights’</h2>

<p>Just weeks after the Quaker split, Mott joined with four other women – her sister Martha Wright, Jane Hunt, Mary Ann M’Clintock and Elizabeth Cady Stanton – to organize a women’s rights convention. Among them, Stanton was the only non-Quaker. She and Mott had met during the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1002/9781405198073.wbierp1607"">World’s Anti-Slavery Convention</a> in 1848, held in London, where British organizers refused to recognize the American female delegates because of their gender.</p>

<p>Although the women agreed on the necessity of a women’s rights convention, they disagreed on the form and content. At their initial meeting, <a href=""https://www.pennpress.org/9780812222791/lucretia-motts-heresy/"">the five proposed to discuss the “social, civil, and religious condition of women”</a> – placing women’s oppression within a larger constellation of social evils. Stanton, however, listed the lack of suffrage as woman’s most urgent grievance. </p>

<p>Ultimately, the Seneca Falls Convention produced the Declaration of Sentiments, which celebrated women’s worthiness, criticized their subjugation and articulated the rights they deserved. Participants also passed <a href=""https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/wooda/2B-HUM/Readings/Womens-Rights.pdf"">12 resolutions</a> designed to provide for women’s equality, affirming their right to occupy “such a station in society” as their “conscience shall dictate,” and their “sacred right to the elective franchise.”</p>

<p>The Quaker influence on the convention is most apparent in the differing views held by its two most influential leaders, Stanton and Mott. <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/wori/learn/historyculture/elizabeth-cady-stanton.htm"">Stanton rejected</a> the need to introduce other issues into the fight for women’s rights, believing that once women gained political and legal power, more reforms would follow.</p>

<p>Mott, on the other hand, saw women’s oppression as one of many threats to individual liberty, from slavery and abusive prisons to the treatment of Native Americans. Real change, she believed, would require going to the root of the problem: “<a href=""https://www.pennpress.org/9780812222791/lucretia-motts-heresy/"">mindless tradition and savage greed</a>.” As Mott <a href=""https://www.wwhp.org/Resources/davis_history.html"">would later note</a>, “Among Quakers there had never been any talk of woman’s rights – it was simply human rights.”</p>

    <p>The <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/worldwide-refugees-reach-all-time-high/"">number of refugees worldwide</a> reached record high levels in 2022. More than 108.4 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of violence or persecution. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://hir.harvard.edu/new-technologies-that-monitor-displaced-persons/"">governments and aid agencies are increasingly using</a> a <a href=""https://www.digital-adoption.com/what-is-digital-technology/"">controversial method</a> of effectively identifying and tracking many refugees. </p>

<p>This method, known as biometrics, involves collecting someone’s physical or behavioral characteristics, ranging from fingerprints to voice. Organizations that collect the personal physical data can store it to instantly recognize someone after scanning their fingerprints or irises, for example. </p>

<p>The United Nations refugee agency, often known as UNHCR, is among the groups that have grown their <a href=""https://www.unhcr.org/blogs/unhcrs-biometric-tools-in-2023/#:%7E:text=UNHCR%2C%20the%20UN%20Refugee%20Agency,in%20countries%20across%20the%20world"">biometrics programs</a> over the past several years to <a href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/02/big-brother-turns-its-eye-on-refugees/"">help identify refugees</a> and deliver lifesaving aid and other services. </p>

<p>As a <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ITS9Jk4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"">cybersecurity scholar</a>, I think it is important to understand that while identifying people using biometrics might be convenient for organizations collecting the data, the practice comes with inherent privacy risks that can threaten vulnerable people’s safety. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The biometrics data-gathering process begins with <a href=""https://iow.eui.eu/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2013/04/07-Rijpma-Background4-Refugees-and-Biometrics.pdf"">enrollment, which involves</a> representatives from a government or organization collecting someone’s personal physical information when they perform intake into a registration system.</p>

<p>Many people also routinely use biometrics for personal reasons, like recording their own fingerprints so they can unlock and use their phone.</p>

<p>Organizations can use this kind of personal biometric information to authenticate a person’s identity – meaning, confirming that a person is who they say they are. Or, they can use it to simply identify someone and determine who they are. </p>

<p>Authentication works by comparing a person’s previously captured images or recordings – their biometrics – with their recently collected biometrics information.</p>

<p>Identification, on the other hand, compares a person’s recently collected biometrics against all other people’s templates stored in a biometrics database. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics"">U.S. law enforcement</a> and international <a href=""https://www.cntraveler.com/story/how-airports-are-using-biometrics-so-you-can-spend-less-time-waiting-in-lines"">travel-related companies</a> alike tend to use biometrics in their work. <a href=""https://le.fbi.gov/science-and-lab/biometrics-and-fingerprints/biometrics/next-generation-identification-ngi"">That ranges from identifying</a> re-offending criminals across multiple jurisdictions, for example, or quickly identifying people as they <a href=""https://www.tsa.gov/biometrics-technology#:%7E:text=During%20the%20tests%2C%20TSA%20will,between%20TSA%20officers%20and%20passengers."">pass through an airport</a> or cross an international border. </p>

<h2>Cybersecurity challenges</h2>

<p>For groups of people like refugees who might not be carrying passports or other forms of identification, biometrics provides a convenient and reliable way to verify their identities while reducing the risk of fraud.</p>

<p>Aid workers can also use <a href=""https://www.asisonline.org/security-management-magazine/monthly-issues/security-technology/archive/2021/december/reaching-the-remote-with-fingerprint-biometrics/"">biometrics systems in remote areas</a> with limited cell service or internet, which is common in refugee processing centers in poor countries. </p>

<p>More than <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2019-06-21/biometric-data-is-being-collected-from-refugees-asylum-seekers/11209274"">80% of the refugees</a> registered with UNHCR have a biometric record. In most cases, this is considered a standard practice that is necessary for refugees to receive aid. </p>

<p>In Jordan, for instance, <a href=""https://help.unhcr.org/jordan/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2022/04/Biometrics-EN_Final_April2022.pdf"">UNHCR uses</a> uses iris scans to identify refugees and distribute monthly allowances. </p>

<h2>Human rights concerns</h2>

<p>But refugees and advocacy groups alike have voiced <a href=""https://odi.org/en/publications/digital-identity-biometrics-and-inclusion-in-humanitarian-responses-to-refugee-crises/"">human rights concerns</a>, arguing that collecting refugees’ biometric data can put an already vulnerable group at risk. That can happen if a militant group or government that pushed people to become refugees gets hold of their personal information and is able to potentially identify them if they are in hiding. </p>

<p>Unlike passwords and PIN numbers, fingerprints and facial recognition are unique and cannot be changed if there is a security breach. </p>

<p>Ukrainians in need of aid following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine <a href=""https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2023/07/11/you-dont-need-demand-sensitive-biometric-data-give-aid-ukraine-response-shows"">have pushed back on UNHCR</a> and other U.N. agencies using biometrics. As a result, it has become more common there for people to be registered in other ways, such as by using their Ukrainian national tax identity numbers or their passports. </p>

<p>Another concern observers have made is that if a biometric database is breached, <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack"">cybercriminals can take</a> people’s data and try to impersonate them and steal their identities. </p>

<p>Security breaches can be <a href=""https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/threat-actor/"">particularly dangerous</a> for refugees.</p>

<p>Researchers at the University of North Carolina exposed flaws of compromised biometric systems in 2016 <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/08/hackers-trick-facial-recognition-logins-photos-facebook-thanks-zuck/"">when they designed</a> an experiment to spoof facial recognition systems. The researchers downloaded social media photos of volunteers and and used the images to construct three-dimensional replicas of faces. The 3D-developed faces successfully tricked four of the five facial recognition systems. </p>

<h2>Things have gone wrong</h2>

<p>Refugees and other people in vulnerable positions have experienced devastating consequences after <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/15/un-put-rohingya-at-risk-by-sharing-data-without-consent-says-rights-group"">having their biometric data breached</a>. </p>

<p>For instance, the Taliban in Afghanistan seized the <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-taliban-may-have-access-to-the-biometric-data-of-civilians-who-helped-the-u-s-military-166475"">U.S. military’s biometric collection and identification</a> devices in August 2021 after the U.S. withdrew its final troops from Afghanistan. The U.S. collected and used this <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2021/08/17/afghanistan-taliban-military-biometrics/"">data to track terrorists</a> and other potential insurgents. </p>

<p>Human rights activists expressed <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-built-biometric-system-sparks-concerns-afghans-rcna1829"">concern that the Taliban could use the biometric</a> data to identify – and target – Afghans who helped the U.S. coalition forces by serving as translators and in other positions after the U.S. withdrawal. </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.army.mil/article/51768/troopers_deploy_hiide_system_at_border_crossing_point"">biometric devices</a>, contained Afghans’ biometric data, including iris scans and fingerprints. </p>

<p>While the Taliban have said that they will not retaliate against Afghans who had worked with the U.S. and other Western coalition forces, the U.N. has tied <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/30/1033941/afghanistan-biometric-databases-us-military-40-data-points/"">reports of civilians and Afghan soldiers being executed</a> to compromised U.S. biometrics databases. </p>

<p>Similarly, in 2021 news reports revealed that the U.N. shared its <a href=""https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/opinion/2021/6/21/rohingya-data-protection-and-UN-betrayal"">biometric data of more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees</a> living in Bangladesh with the government there. The Bangladeshi government then shared the information with the Myanmar government – the same government that Rohingya refugees feared would hurt or kill them. </p>

<p>The U.S.-based advocacy group Human Rights Watch reported that the U.N. <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/06/15/un-shared-rohingya-data-without-informed-consent"">had informed Rohingya refugees</a> that they needed to give their biometrics information in order to receive lifesaving aid and other services from the U.N. Some people interviewed in refugee camps said that they went into hiding after they learned that their information had been shared. </p>

<h2>A need for reform</h2>

<p>I believe that there is a need to consider whether and how refugees are giving consent for the recording <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/15/un-put-rohingya-at-risk-by-sharing-data-without-consent-says-rights-group"">of their personal information</a> – and whether refugees are fully informed of the inherent risks associated with biometric system use. </p>

<p>At a minimum, I think that UNHCR and other groups collecting biometric data information should set up stronger <a href=""https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/"">security models</a> and undertake routine <a href=""https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/22_1201_safecom_guide_to_cybersecurity_risk_assessment_508-r1.pdf"">cyber risk assessments</a> to understand evolving threats. </p>

<p>Without the necessary money and technological ability to respond to cyberthreats, U.N. agencies and others will remain vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can undermine people’s rights and ability to find safe refuge.</p>

    <p>China is entering a <a href=""https://theconversation.com/why-chinas-shrinking-population-is-a-big-deal-counting-the-social-economic-and-political-costs-of-an-aging-smaller-society-198056"">severe demographic crisis</a>. </p>

<p>For several centuries, the Asian nation has been the most populous country in the world. But it is now shrinking. In 2022, the country registered <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/16/business/china-birth-rate.html"">more deaths than births</a>, and it will soon be surpassed by India in total population size – indeed, many demographers <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/24/india-overtakes-china-to-become-worlds-most-populous-country"">believe this has already occurred</a>.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jAfhO2YAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">a scholar who has studied</a> China’s demography for almost 40 years, I know the likelihood is this falling population will lead to an <a href=""https://theconversation.com/why-chinas-shrinking-population-is-a-big-deal-counting-the-social-economic-and-political-costs-of-an-aging-smaller-society-198056"">economic slowdown</a>, with a greater number of dependents and fewer workers to support them. Yet attempts to reverse the trend through policy that <a href=""https://www.wionews.com/world/china-comes-up-with-20-recommendations-to-encourage-families-to-have-more-children-572313"">encourages couples to have more children</a> have proved ineffective. China will need to turn to other measures to solve its population problem. In short, China needs immigrants.</p>

<h2>More babies or more immigrants?</h2>

<p>The scale of the demographic task facing policymakers in Beijing is vast.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>In 2022, the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2023/01/17/1149453055/china-records-1st-population-fall-in-decades-as-births-drop"">Chinese government reported</a> 10.41 million deaths in the country and 9.56 million births. This was the first time China has seen more annual deaths than births since the <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/08/03/giving-historys-greatest-mass-murderer-his-due/"">Great Leap Forward</a> of 1958 to 1962 – during which a severe famine resulting from bad economic policies contributed to 30 million to 40 million more deaths than would have been expected.</p>

<p>If present trends continue, China is expected to lose more than a third of its 1.4 billion population. Some projections have the country dropping to a <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/7/15/population-in-more-than-20-countries-to-halve-by-2100-study"">population of 800 million by the year 2100</a>.</p>

<p><iframe id=""4GUP2"" class=""tc-infographic-datawrapper"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4GUP2/1/"" style=""border: medium none; height: 394px;"" width=""100%"" height=""400px"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>

<p>The impact of this change will be felt across Chinese society. The country is already aging. The <a href=""https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/median-age-china-surpassed-united-states"">median age in China is now 38</a> compared to 28 just two decades ago. In contrast, India today has <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/india-population/"">a median age of 28</a>. People of age 65 and over <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/09/key-facts-as-india-surpasses-china-as-the-worlds-most-populous-country/"">now comprise 14% of China’s population</a> compared to 7% of India’s.</p>

<p>Once a nation’s population is in decline, there are only two ways to reverse the trend: encourage people to have more children or get people from outside the country to move in.</p>

<p>Many Chinese leaders believe that they can increase China’s population by changing the nation’s fertility policies. In 2015, the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/china-abandons-one-child-policy"">government abandoned the one-child policy</a>, permitting all couples in China to have two children. In 2021, the two-child policy was abandoned <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/world/asia/china-three-child-policy.html"">in favor of a three-child policy</a>. The hope was these changes would result in sizable increases in the national fertility rate, which now stands at 1.2 – well below the level of 2.1 children per woman of childbearing age that is needed to replace the population. </p>

<p>But these policy changes have not led to fertility increases in China, and there is little reason to think they will result in any dramatic uptick in the years ahead. This is because most of China’s fertility reduction, especially since the 1990s, has been voluntary and more a result of modernization than fertility control policies. Chinese couples are having fewer children <a href=""https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/6/9/despite-three-child-policy-many-in-china-cant-afford-more-kids"">due to the higher living costs and educational expenses</a> involved in having more than one child.</p>

<h2>Entering the ‘low fertility trap’</h2>

<p>The total fertility rate in China might go up over the next decade by 0.1 or 0.2 at best, in my opinion. But demographers largely agree that it will never go up by 1.0 or 2.0 – the kind of increase needed if China is to reach the replacement level.</p>

<p>And then there is what demographers refer to as the “<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/17/europe/italy-record-low-birth-rate-intl-cmd/index.html"">low fertility trap</a>.” This hypothesis, advanced by demographers in the early 2000s, holds that once a country’s fertility rate drops below 1.5 or 1.4 – and China’s is now at 1.2 – it is very difficult to increase it by a significant amount. The argument goes that fertility declines to these low levels are largely the result of changes in living standards and increasing opportunities for women.</p>

<p>As a result, it is most unlikely that the three-child policy will have any influence at all on raising the fertility rate.</p>

<p>Which leaves immigration. China right now has few residents who were born in a foreign country – there are <a href=""https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/04/china-needs-foreign-workers-so-why-wont-it-embrace-immigration"">now only around 1 million foreign-born residents</a> in China, or less than 0.1% of the population.</p>

<p>In fact, China has the smallest number of international migrants of <a href=""https://qz.com/1163632/china-still-has-the-smallest-share-of-incoming-migrants-in-the-world"">any major country in the world</a>. Compare its 0.1% of immigrants with <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/15/us/where-immigrants-come-from-cec/index.html"">near 14% in the U.S.</a> and <a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/germany-immigrants-made-up-over-18-of-2022-population/a-65383249"">18% in Germany</a>. Even Japan and South Korea – which historically have not been high-immigration countries – have higher percentages of foreign-born population, <a href=""https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/06/23/japan-immigration-policy-xenophobia-migration/"">2% in Japan</a> and <a href=""https://inmykorea.com/how-many-foreigners-in-korea/#:%7E:text=Currently%2C%20foreign%20residents%20make%20up,increase%20to%204.3%25%20by%202040."">3% in South Korea</a>.</p>

<p>It isn’t just the low numbers of immigrants that is a problem. China also faces the problem of growing numbers of its population moving to other countries, including the U.S. In 2017, for example, an <a href=""https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/publications/migrationreport/docs/MigrationReport2017_Highlights.pdf"">estimated 10 million people moved from China</a> to live and work in other countries.</p>

<h2>Overcoming racial purity</h2>

<p>China must change its immigration policies if it is to reverse its demographic trend. </p>

<p>Currently, foreign-born people cannot attain Chinese citizenship unless they are children of Chinese nationals. Also, foreigners are only allowed to purchase one piece of property in China, and it must be their residence.</p>

<p>But changing immigration policy will likely require a change in mindset. </p>

<p>In a recent story in The Economist, the <a href=""https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/04/china-needs-foreign-workers-so-why-wont-it-embrace-immigration"">reporter notes that Chinese</a> “officials boast of a single Chinese bloodline dating back thousands of years.” And that taps into a seemingly <a href=""https://thediplomat.com/2020/04/racism-is-alive-and-well-in-china/"">deep-rooted belief in racial purity</a> held by <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/world/asia/china-sperm-communist-party.html"">many leaders in</a> the Chinese Communist Party. In 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/isagsq/article/2/4/ksac070/6947853"">told Donald Trump</a>, then America’s president: “We people are the original people, black hair, yellow skin, inherited onwards. We call ourselves the descendants of the dragon.”</p>

<p>The best way to maintain this racial purity, <a href=""https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005267"">many in China believe</a>, is to limit or prohibit migration into China.</p>

<p>But relaxing immigration policy will not only boost numbers, it will also offset any drop in productivity caused by an aging population. Immigrants are typically of prime working age and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/immigrants-outperform-native-born-americans-two-key-measures-financial-success-n1020291"">very productive</a>; they also tend to <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/10/26/5-facts-about-immigrant-mothers-and-u-s-fertility-trends/"">have more babies</a> than native-born residents.</p>

<p>The U.S. and many European countries have relied for decades on international migration to <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/03/08/immigration-projected-to-drive-growth-in-u-s-working-age-population-through-at-least-2035/"">bolster their working-age population</a>. For immigration to have any reasonable impacts in China, the numbers of people coming into China will need to increase tremendously in the next decade or so – to around 50 million, perhaps higher. Otherwise, in the coming decades, China’s demographic destiny will be one of population losses every year, with more deaths than births, and the country will soon have one of the oldest populations in the world.</p>

    <p>The blanket of wildfire smoke that spread across large parts of the U.S. and Canada in 2023 was a wake-up call, showing what climate change could feel like in the near future for millions of people.</p>

<p>First, as the organic-rich Arctic soils dry up because of changing climate conditions, they can burn slowly and release vast amounts of smoke into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Second, soil fires that spread underground are <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wildfires-peat-challenge-alberta-firefighters-1.6850347"">harder for firefighters to tame and extinguish</a>, thus demanding more resources for longer periods of time. Firefighters in Alberta, Canada, where carbon-rich peatlands are common, have been dealing with fires smoldering to depths dozens of feet underground in 2023. Because peat fires <a href=""https://srd.web.alberta.ca/edson-area-update"">can make the ground unstable</a>, using heavy equipment to excavate the fire areas also becomes risky.</p>

<p>Finally, these soil fires <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/zombie-fires-in-the-arctic-are-linked-to-climate-change"">don’t die easily</a>. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03437-y"">Recent research</a> finds that Arctic soil fires can smolder through the winter and reignite during early spring when temperatures rise, hence the nickname “zombie fires.”</p>

<h2>The Arctic is increasingly flammable</h2>

<p>Wildfires have been a natural part of northern forest and tundra ecosystems for thousand of years. However, the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9768"">severity, frequency and types</a> of wildfires in northern and Arctic regions have changed in recent decades.</p>

<p>One major culprit is the rising temperature: The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the world, a phenomenon known as <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-022-00498-3"">Arctic amplification</a>.</p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">A visualization of temperature changes compared with the 1951-1980 average shows the Arctic warming significantly faster than much of the world.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>While governing bodies that are working to curtail the pace of climate change worry about exceeding a 1.5-degree Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) threshold globally, the Arctic has already exceeded a 2 C (3.6 F) increase compared with pre-industrial times. That rise in temperature brings with it a number of changes to the environment that make the forest and tundra more susceptible to burning, for longer, and in more extensive ways than just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Among the changing conditions that favor wildfires are changes in atmospheric circulation that create periods of extreme heat, dry out vegetation and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9768"">reduce moisture in soils</a>, and, importantly, lead to more <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6311"">frequent lightning strikes</a> that can spark blazes.</p>

<p>Although lightning remains infrequent at very high latitudes, it is <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6311"">expected to increase</a> and expand over <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9768"">larger territories into the far north</a> as the climate warms and generates more storms that can produce lightning. In 2022, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/alaska-on-fire-thousands-of-lightning-strikes-and-a-warming-climate-put-alaska-on-pace-for-another-historic-fire-season-186453"">thousands of lightning strikes</a> help sparked one of Alaska’s worst fire seasons on record.</p>

<p>As the Arctic warms and fires move farther northward, peat soils rich in dead plant material <a href=""https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-studies-how-arctic-wildfires-change-the-world"">burn at an accelerated rate</a>. </p>

<p>The burning peat also removes the layer insulating permafrost, the region’s frozen carbon-rich soil. Northern ecosystems store <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/WILDFIRE-EMISSIONS/zjvqkrwmnvx/index.html"">twice as much carbon</a> in their peat and permafrost as the atmosphere, and both are increasingly vulnerable to fire.</p>

<p>About <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abn9768"">70% of recorded area of Arctic peat</a> affected by burning over the past 40 years occurred in the last eight years, and 30% of it was in 2020 alone, showing the acceleration. </p>

<h2>What is a zombie fire?</h2>

<p>Most people picture wildfires as catastrophic flames consuming trees and grasses. Ground fires, on the other hand, do not flame but burn more slowly and have the tendency to spread deep into the ground and spread laterally. </p>

<p>The result is that ground-smoldering fires are not only less visible, but they are also less accessible and require <a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/wildfires-peat-challenge-alberta-firefighters-1.6850347"">digging up and dousing</a> with lots of water. </p>

<p>These smoldering fires also produce more smoke because of their lower temperature of combustion. Ultra-fine particles in smoke are <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21708-0"">particularly harmful</a> to the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and can be carried far and wide by winds.</p>

<p>Because of the slow combustion process and the abundance of fuel in the form of carbon and oxygen, smoldering ground fires can also <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coesh.2021.100296"">burn for months and sometimes years</a>. They have been shown to “<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03437-y"">overwinter</a>,” persisting through the cold season to reemerge in the warm, dry season. During the <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02568-y"">2019-2020 fire season in Siberia</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/climate/climate-change-zombie-forest-fires.html"">zombie fires</a> were blamed for rekindling fires the following year.</p>

<p>Some of these ground fires can become so massive that they release smoke plumes that cover vast geographical regions. In 1997, peat fires in Indonesia sent <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-022-00872-w"">dangerous levels of smoke</a> across Southeast Asia and parts of Australia and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/nature01131"">increased carbon emissions</a>. They were ignited by slash-and-burn activities to plant palm plantations and amplified by drought conditions during a severe El Niño event.</p>

<h2>Some hope and caution from past lessons</h2>

<p>I have been studying the effects of <a href=""https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.6b02132"">wildfires on air</a> and <a href=""https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014gl062762"">water</a>, including in the Arctic, for many years. My work and that of many colleagues, however, focus on the combustion of above-ground biomass. More work is needed to understand the full extent of zombie fires in the Arctic and their potential for carbon and smoke emissions on a large scale. One recent study conducted at a handful of Canadian sites offered some hope, suggesting underground fires there <a href=""https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-17450.html"">were burning more in tree roots</a> than in soil, suggesting potentially lower carbon emissions in some areas.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the continuing waves of wildfire haze in Canada and the U.S. are a reminder of the impact of these fires. </p>

<p>More regions will need help from trained firefighters, meaning sharing firefighting resources. Canada has seen an <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/07/canada-wildfires-summer-weather-temps"">unprecedented level of international fire support</a> in 2023. Best practices for safely fighting zombie fires are also needed, along with better public education about the health risks of wildfire smoke.</p>

<p>As a society, we are learning to live with some of the effects of climate change, but the risks are rising around the world.</p>

    <p>The Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation of ChatGPT maker OpenAI for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/"">potential violations of consumer protection laws</a>. The FTC sent the company a 20-page demand for information in the week of July 10, 2023. The move comes as European regulators <a href=""https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence"">have begun to take action</a>, and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/21/ai-regulation-us-senate-chuck-schumer/"">Congress is working on legislation</a> to regulate the artificial intelligence industry.</p>

<p>The FTC has asked OpenAI to provide details of all complaints the company has received from users regarding “<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf"">false, misleading, disparaging, or harmful</a>” statements put out by OpenAI, and whether OpenAI engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers, including reputational harm. The agency has asked detailed questions about how OpenAI obtains its data, how it trains its models, the processes it uses for human feedback, risk assessment and mitigation, and its mechanisms for privacy protection.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JpFHYKcAAAAJ"">As a researcher of social media and AI</a>, I recognize the immensely transformative potential of generative AI models, but I believe that these systems <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3531146.3533088"">pose risks</a>. In particular, in the context of consumer protection, these models can produce errors, exhibit biases and violate personal data privacy.</p>

<p></p><div data-react-class=""Tweet"" data-react-props=""{&quot;tweetId&quot;:&quot;1679602640752345089&quot;}""><div><div twdiv=""yes""></div></div></div><p></p>

<h2>Hidden power</h2>

<p>At the heart of chatbots such as ChatGPT and image generation tools such as DALL-E lies the power of generative AI models that can create realistic content from text, images, audio and video inputs. These tools can be accessed through a browser or a smartphone app. </p>

<p>Since <a href=""https://ainowinstitute.org/publication/large-scale-ai-models"">these AI models have no predefined use</a>, they can be fine-tuned for a wide range of applications in a variety of domains ranging from finance to biology. The models, trained on vast quantities of data, can be adapted for different tasks with little to no coding and sometimes as easily as by describing a task in simple language.</p>

<p>Given that AI models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 were developed by private organizations using proprietary data sets, the public doesn’t know <a href=""https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-05-16%20-%20Testimony%20-%20Marcus.pdf"">the nature of the data used to train them</a>. The opacity of training data and the complexity of the model architecture – GPT-3 was <a href=""https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/openai-presents-gpt-3-a-175-billion-parameters-language-model/"">trained on over 175 billion variables or “parameters”</a> – make it difficult for anyone to audit these models. Consequently, it’s <a href=""https://www.wired.com/story/large-language-models-artificial-intelligence/"">difficult to prove that the way they are built or trained causes harm</a>.</p>

<h2>Hallucinations</h2>

<p>In language model AIs, a hallucination is a confident response that is <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3571730"">inaccurate and seemingly not justified by a model’s training data</a>. Even some generative AI models that were designed to be less prone to hallucinations <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2022.naacl-main.387"">have amplified them</a>. </p>

<p>There is a danger that generative AI models can produce incorrect or misleading information that can end up being damaging to users. A study investigating ChatGPT’s ability to generate factually correct scientific writing in the medical field found that ChatGPT ended up either <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7759%2Fcureus.35179"">generating citations to nonexistent papers or reporting nonexistent results</a>. My collaborators and I <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2023.ed.v34.n2"">found similar patterns</a> in our investigations. </p>

<p>Such hallucinations can cause real damage when the models are used without adequate supervision. For example, ChatGPT <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/04/05/chatgpt-lies/"">falsely claimed that a professor it named had been accused of sexual harassment</a>. And a radio host has filed a <a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/openai-hit-with-first-defamation-suit-over-chatgpt-hallucination"">defamation lawsuit against OpenAI</a> regarding ChatGPT falsely claiming that there was a legal complaint against him for embezzlement.</p>

<h2>Bias and discrimination</h2>

<p>Without adequate safeguards or protections, generative AI models trained on vast quantities of data collected from the internet can end up replicating existing societal biases. For example, organizations that use generative AI models to design recruiting campaigns could end up unintentionally discriminating against some groups of people. </p>

<p>When a journalist asked DALL-E 2 to generate images of “a technology journalist writing an article about a new AI system that can create remarkable and strange images,” <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/openai-dall-e-2"">it generated only pictures of men</a>. An AI portrait app <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445869"">exhibited several sociocultural biases</a>, for example by lightening the skin color of an actress. </p>

<h2>Data privacy</h2>

<p>Another major concern, especially pertinent to the FTC investigation, is the risk of privacy breaches where the AI may end up revealing sensitive or confidential information. A hacker could gain access to sensitive information about people whose data was used to train an AI model. </p>

<p>Researchers have cautioned about risks from manipulations called prompt injection attacks, which <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi2240"">can trick generative AI into giving out information that it shouldn’t</a>. “Indirect prompt injection” attacks <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adi2240"">could trick AI models</a> with steps such as sending someone a calendar invitation with instructions for their digital assistant to export the recipient’s data and send it to the hacker.</p>

<h2>Some solutions</h2>

<p>The European Commission has published <a href=""https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai"">ethical guidelines for trustworthy AI</a> that include an assessment checklist for six different aspects of AI systems: human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency, diversity, nondiscrimination and fairness; societal and environmental well-being; and accountability. </p>

<p>Better documentation of AI developers’ processes can help in highlighting potential harms. For example, researchers of algorithmic fairness <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287596"">have proposed model cards</a>, which are similar to nutritional labels for food. <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00041"">Data statements</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723"">datasheets</a>, which characterize data sets used to train AI models, would serve a similar role. </p>

<p>Amazon Web Services, for instance, introduced AI service cards that describe the uses and limitations of <a href=""https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/amazon-introduces-service-cards-to-enhance-responsible-ai/"">some models it provides</a>. The cards describe the models’ capabilities, training data and intended uses.</p>

<p>The FTC’s inquiry hints that this type of disclosure may be a direction that U.S. regulators take. Also, if the FTC finds OpenAI has violated consumer protection laws, it could fine the company or put it under a consent decree.</p>

    <p>For the <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/movie-stars-to-strike-friday-in-hollywoods-biggest-labor-fight-in-decades"">first time since 1960, actors</a> and <a href=""https://theconversation.com/the-exploitation-of-hollywoods-writers-is-just-another-symptom-of-digital-feudalism-204984"">screenwriters are on strike</a> at the same time.</p>

<p>As with <a href=""https://theconversation.com/america-is-in-the-middle-of-a-labor-mobilization-moment-with-self-organizers-at-starbucks-amazon-trader-joes-and-chipotle-behind-the-union-drive-189826"">many of the other strikes that have rippled</a> across the United States over the past three years, this walkout is over demands for better pay and restrictions on their <a href=""https://www.marketplace.org/shows/marketplace-tech/labor-unions-fight-against-ai-is-nothing-new/"">employers’ use of technology</a> to replace paid work.</p>

<p><a href=""https://apnews.com/article/actors-strike-explained-2607dd29da6c16c0a406359a7e86d7fb"">The actors’ strike began</a> on July 14, 2023, after their union, SAG-AFTRA, voted to end negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents the major production studios. The main concerns of the union – which represents 160,000 actors and people in other creative professions – center around compensation on streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, and <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/hollywood-actor-sag-aftra-ai-artificial-intelligence-strike-rcna94191"">artificial intelligence</a>. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/23696617/writers-strike-wga-2023-explained-residuals-streaming-ai"">Screenwriters, who have been on strike</a> since May 2, have similar concerns.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>The two strikes have halted U.S. TV and movie production. <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/film/global/matt-damon-oppenheimer-cast-moved-red-carpet-strike-1235669528/"">Premieres are being canceled</a>, and <a href=""https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/emmys-sag-aftra-strike-will-prevent-actors-from-campaigning-for-awards/"">Emmy-nominated actors aren’t campaigning</a> for those prestigious TV awards.</p>

<h2>Rewind to the rise of TV</h2>

<p>Ever since Louis Le Prince <a href=""https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-was-the-first-movie-ever-made/"">filmed the first movie</a>, “Roundhay Garden Scene,” in 1888, actors have earned a living through their work being shown on screens small and large.</p>

<p>The first hit <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/bigdream-tv-milestones/"">shows on TV aired in the mid-1940s</a>, but actors initially earned far less from television than movies. Around 1960, with the advent of hits like “Leave It to Beaver,” “Beverly Hillbillies” and “Bonanza,” <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2307/1224894"">TV became very profitable</a>. TV’s growing prestige and economic heft gave television actors newfound power at the contract negotiating table.</p>

<p>Actors demanded that their craft be compensated for TV shows about as highly as for their film appearances. <a href=""https://time.com/6294777/sag-wga-strike-1960/"">Led by future President Ronald Reagan</a> and Charlton Heston – who went on to serve as a National Rifle Association president – the Screen Actors Guild went on strike on March 7, 1960. Among that union’s top demands: health care coverage and <a href=""https://ps.extremereach.com/blog/what-are-residuals-in-film-and-tv-production/"">residuals for movies aired on television, reruns and syndication</a>. </p>

<p>Residuals are a form of royalty paid to actors when movies and TV shows air on television after their initial run. That can include reruns, syndication and the broadcasting of movies on television.</p>

<p>The actors union’s strike, which <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/actors-strike-explained-2607dd29da6c16c0a406359a7e86d7fb"">coincided then as today</a> with a screenwriters strike, <a href=""https://www.sagaftra.org/membership-benefits/residuals/history-residuals"">successfully negotiated</a> a contract with executives that resolved the residuals conflict and secured health care coverage for its members. </p>

<p>That contract applied to broadcasting and, years later, cable TV.</p>

<p>But it doesn’t work for streaming, because streamed shows aren’t scheduled. Whereas “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108778/"">Friends</a>,” a sitcom that initially aired on NBC, is available today on Max, formerly HBO Max, through syndication, and its actors receive relevant residuals, “<a href=""https://www.netflix.com/title/70242311"">Orange Is the New Black</a>” originated on Netflix. Because it never runs on a different platform via syndication, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@itskimiko/video/6904342710782676229?lang=en"">the actors in its cast</a> <a href=""https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/read-orange-black-cast-cutting-141628579.html"">earn paltry residuals</a> in comparison – even though viewers are still watching the show’s seven seasons.</p>

<p>Hwang Dong-hyuk, the creator of “<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/oct/26/squid-games-creator-rich-netflix-bonus-hwang-dong-hyuk"">Squid Game</a>,” forfeited all residuals when he cut a deal with Netflix. It <a href=""https://www.ign.com/articles/squid-game-creator-rights-residuals"">earned Netflix nearly US$1 billion</a>, but Hwang got none of that bounty.</p>

<h2>Fast-forward to 2023</h2>

<p>As I explained in my 2021 book, “<a href=""https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/9781839827686"">Streaming Culture</a>,” streaming has fundamentally changed the production and consumption of both TV and film while blurring the lines between them.</p>

<p>People consume different types of media through subscriptions and streaming technology than they do while watching broadcast TV and cable television. Actors and writers are concerned that their <a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/mychalthompson/sagaftra-actors-residuals"">compensation hasn’t kept up</a> with this transformation.</p>

<p>And the <a href=""https://twitter.com/brocktocks/status/1679540876589273088"">actors who are on strike argue</a> that the formulas in place since 1960 to calculate residuals don’t work anymore.</p>

<p>Residuals paid for roles in broadcast TV shows are based on the popularity of those programs, with actors earning far more for hits like “Grey’s Anatomy” and “NCIS” than for duds. Hit shows can have a second life on streaming platforms and result in actors getting paid again for that earlier work.</p>

<p>In contrast, streaming residuals <a href=""https://deadline.com/2023/04/hollywood-strike-streaming-residuals-wga-producers-1235325130/"">pay a flat rate</a> for foreign and domestic streams. A streaming original film or TV show earns a set amount for residuals in its domestic market and second set amount for foreign markets. This fee doesn’t change based on popularity or the number of times a production is streamed. </p>

<p>But streaming has changed more than residuals for actors and writers. It has also transformed how TV shows are made.</p>

<p>Many <a href=""https://screenrant.com/why-tv-show-seasons-shorter-reason/"">TV seasons have grown shorter</a> since streaming became the norm, falling from 20 or more episodes to 10 or fewer per season.</p>

<p>That’s because streamers <a href=""https://screenrant.com/why-tv-show-seasons-shorter-reason/"">started making shows with lower budgets</a>, as it costs less to produce fewer episodes. The studios also cut costs by hiring fewer writers.</p>

<p>Since actors are typically paid per episode in which they perform, their salaries have <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/07/14/actors-writers-strike-first-day/"">dropped by virtue of having fewer appearances</a> in even the most popular shows.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/9/17662280/tv-shows-gone-too-long-gaps-breaks-between-seasons"">gaps between seasons have also grown longer</a> and more unpredictable. Every season of the nine-year run of “Seinfeld” on NBC began in the fall and ended the next spring, then picked up again the next fall.</p>

<p>Streaming shows are far less predictable.</p>

<p>Amazon Prime’s “<a href=""https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a39093712/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-4-new-episodes-schedule-details/"">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a>” paused for more than two years between seasons 3 and 4.</p>

<p>The same streamer aired the first season of “<a href=""https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-2-cast-plot-and-more/"">Lord of the Rings: Power of the Rings</a>,” in September 2022, but Season 2 won’t be released until late 2024. </p>

<p>As gaps between seasons grow, some <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/streaming-shows-removed-residuals-4be3ac859c766c352e57ef96176fd812"">actors are having a harder and harder time making ends meet</a>.</p>

<p>Another change has to do with the question of whether particular shows will keep going. In conventional broadcast or cable television, networks determine whether they will renew a show during the period known as “<a href=""https://www.boombroadcast.com/boom-blog/2015/04/10/what-is-sweeps-and-how-does-can-it-affect-television-coverage"">sweeps</a>,” at the end of a TV season. Since streaming television has no defined seasons, these decisions can drag on. </p>

<p>This can leave actors and writers in limbo. And their <a href=""https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/read-first-contract-1570/"">contracts often stop them</a>  from <a href=""https://longreads.com/2015/04/01/the-1944-court-decision-that-changed-hollywood/"">working on other shows between seasons</a>.</p>

<h2>Will AI erase actors?</h2>

<p>Although residuals and the number of episodes have until now been negotiable, perhaps the strike’s biggest issue is the studios’ use of <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/07/14/actors-writers-strike-first-day/"">artificial intelligence</a></p>

<p>Actors fear studios will use AI to replace actors in the future. Without a contract that says otherwise, once a studio films an actor, it can potentially use the actor’s likeness in perpetuity. This means a background actor could be shot for one episode of a TV show and continue to be seen in the background <a href=""https://movieweb.com/tom-hanks-keep-acting-after-death-ai/"">for seasons without pay</a>. </p>

<p>That hasn’t happened yet, but many actors are <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/hollywood-ai-writers-strike-tech-b2376457.html"">certain</a> it will.</p>

<p>Actors object to the possibility that studios will seek to “own our likeness in perpetuity, including after we’re dead, use us in their movies without any consent, without any compensation to our performers, especially background performers,” said actor <a href=""https://www.democracynow.org/2023/7/14/sag_aftra_strike_begins"">Shaan Sharma</a>, best known for his role on “The Chosen.” “It’s inhumane. It is dystopian.” </p>

<p>Until now, actors and writers say, the studios <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/hollywood-writers-actors-strike-sag-aftra/#link-O22LAXPUCRCPTEKL3RU66ZA6WA"">have refused to negotiate over AI</a> with actors or writers. But both unions see AI as a threat to their members’ livelihoods, a point SAG-AFTRA President <a href=""https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sag-strike-fran-drescher-speech-actors-writers-rcna94096"">Fran Drescher made on MSNBC</a>.</p>

<p>As Drescher continually points out in her media appearances, 99% of actors are <a href=""https://www.thewrap.com/morning-joe-sag-aftra-strike-wga-support/"">struggling on working-class incomes</a>. Meanwhile, studio executives continue to increase their own pay. <a href=""https://deadline.com/2023/05/ceo-pay-wga-writers-strike-1235351572/"">For example, in 2022</a>, Netflix co-CEOs Reed Hastings and Ted Sarandos earned roughly $50 million each. Warner-Discovery CEO David Zaslav earned $39 million.</p>

<h2>No ‘pause’ for widening inequality gap</h2>

<p>The gulf between what actors and top executives earn is a major difference between today’s actors and writer strikes and the 1960 strikes. In 1965, executives made 15 times the average salary of their workers. By 2021 <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/17/american-chief-executive-pay-wages-workers"">those top execs were earning 350 times more</a> than the average worker – including actors. </p>

<p>And while today’s biggest stars, like <a href=""https://en.as.com/meristation/news/the-last-of-us-salary-controversy-pedro-pascal-was-paid-9-times-more-than-bella-ramsey-n/"">Pedro Pascal</a> and <a href=""https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/celebrities/highest-paid-streaming-cable-tv-show-actors-actresses/"">Natasha Lyonne</a>, earn millions for every performance, most actors struggle to make ends meet.</p>

<p>In Los Angeles, actors earn an <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/business/hollywood-actors-sag-aftra-strike-by-the-numbers/index.html"">average hourly wage of $27.73</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, studios are pulling in huge profits. For example, Netflix and Warner Bros. earned <a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/studio-profit-paramount-warner-bros-universal-1235354279/"">$5.2 billion and $2.7 billion in 2022</a>, respectively.</p>

<h2>Watching union action on repeat</h2>

<p>As I explain in my new book, “Digital Feudalism: Creators, Credit, Consumption, and Capitalism,” striking actors and screenwriters are part of the wave of labor unrest in recent years. In my view, U.S. <a href=""https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/9781804557662"">workers are rejecting a system</a> that expects workers to buy more on credit while making a living with increasingly precarious jobs. </p>

<p>From <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-starbucks-workers-join-nationwide-unionizing-effort/"">Starbucks baristas</a> to <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/amazon-worker-union-organizer-reinstated-34a6fb1d8fa5ae177f351c3ddff8df45"">Amazon’s union organizers</a> to the workers planning the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/14/economy/ups-strike-economic-impact/index.html"">pending UPS strike</a>, more and more Americans are fighting for higher wages and more control over their schedules.</p>

<p>In fighting threats to their livelihoods, actors and screenwriters are the latest example of a national movement for stronger labor rights.</p>

    <p><em>The <a href=""https://theconversation.com/us/topics/research-brief-83231"">Research Brief</a> is a short take about interesting academic work.</em> </p>

<h2>The big idea</h2>

<p>Children who watched a 1-minute-long gun safety video were more cautious when they found a real handgun hidden in a drawer in our lab compared to children who watched a car safety video, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2023.2397"">according to our randomized clinical trial</a> published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. We observed this difference even though children saw the gun safety video a week earlier at home and even after they had watched scenes from a violent movie in our lab.</p>

<p>We tested 226 children ages 8 to 12. By the flip of a coin, children watched either a gun safety video or car safety video alone at home. Both safety videos featured The Ohio State University Chief of Police in full uniform. Younger children tend to respect authority figures, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1348/135532500167967"">especially those in uniform</a>.</p>

<p>Then a week later, pairs of kids – who were friends or siblings, for example – came to our lab at Ohio State to participate in what we told them was a study about what children do for entertainment.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>First, the child volunteers watched scenes from a PG-rated violent movie. After 20 minutes, they went to a playroom furnished with toys and games like Lego and checkers. The room also contained a file cabinet with two disabled 9 mm handguns hidden in the bottom drawer. We told the kids they could play with any of the toys and games in the room and then left them alone. A hidden camera videotaped the children’s behavior.</p>

<p>By the end of 20 minutes, 96% of the children had found the guns. Children are naturally curious, and <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/09/health/gun-safety-tips-for-home-parents-children-wellness/index.html"">adults often underestimate their ability</a> to find guns hidden in the home.</p>

<p><iframe id=""UtRqp"" class=""tc-infographic-datawrapper"" src=""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UtRqp/5/"" style=""border: medium none; height: 353px;"" width=""100%"" height=""400px"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></p>

<p>Kids who saw the gun safety video (compared to the car safety video) were more likely to tell an adult (33.9% of kids vs. 10.6% of kids), less likely to touch a gun (39.3% vs. 67.3%) and held it for less time if they did touch it (42.0 seconds vs. 99.9 seconds). They were also less likely to pull the trigger (8.9% vs. 29.8%), and pulled the trigger fewer times if they did pull it (4.2 vs. 7.2). </p>

<p>Risk factors that raised the likelihood of engaging in unsafe behavior around the guns included being male, watching age-inappropriate PG-13 and R-rated movies, and interest in guns, as reported by parents.</p>

<p>We also identified several protective factors that made children less likely to engage in unsafe behavior around the guns. One was previous exposure to gun safety material in a course or video. Another was having guns in the home, which makes sense because surveys find that parents with guns are <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2017/06/26/among-u-s-gun-owners-parents-more-likely-than-non-parents-to-keep-their-guns-locked-and-unloaded/"">more likely to talk to their children about gun safety</a> than parents without guns. Finally, having negative attitudes about guns, like believing they’re not cool or fun, made kids less likely to engage in unsafe behavior in our study.</p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>In 2020 in the U.S., <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2201761"">guns killed more people ages 1 through 19</a> than any other cause, including motor vehicle crashes, drug overdoses and poisoning. And the rate of gun-related deaths among U.S. children has been increasing for about a decade. Gun deaths among U.S. children under 18 <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/06/gun-deaths-among-us-kids-rose-50-percent-in-two-years/"">increased from 1,732 in 2019</a> to 2,590 in 2021.</p>

<p>Gun safety videos might be a relatively simple but effective option to help decrease these gun-related deaths and injuries.</p>

<h2>What still isn’t known</h2>

<p>Participants in this study watched the safety video about a week before they came to our lab. Future longitudinal research is needed to establish how long the protective effects of firearm safety videos might last.</p>

<p>To see if our results apply in other situations, future research should also be conducted in a more naturalistic setting – like the home – and with children of a variety of ages and from geographical locations beyond Ohio.</p>

<h2>What other research is being done</h2>

<p>Other research on children and gun safety primarily focuses on access to guns and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2019.1494"">responsible, safe</a> <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.6.707"">and secure gun storage</a>. The <a href=""https://www.aap.org/en/advocacy/state-advocacy/safe-storage-of-firearms/"">American Academy of Pediatrics recommends</a> that gun owners store their firearms unloaded, locked up and separate from ammunition.</p>

<p><em>This article has been updated to clarify the ages of those included in the statistics about gun-related deaths.</em></p>

    <p>Imagine an <a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/history-october-surprise-180960741/"">October surprise</a> like no other: Only a week before Nov. 5, 2024, a video recording reveals a secret meeting between Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The American and Ukrainian presidents agree to immediately initiate Ukraine into NATO under “the special emergency membership protocol” and prepare for a nuclear weapons strike against Russia. Suddenly, the world is on the cusp of Armageddon. </p>

<p>While journalists could point out that <a href=""https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9813/"">no such protocol exists</a> and social media users might notice odd video-gamelike qualities of the video, others might feel that <a href=""https://www.airandspaceforces.com/american-publics-concern-about-nuclear-war-growing-survey-finds/"">their worst fears</a> have been confirmed. When Election Day comes, these concerned citizens may let the video sway their votes, unaware that they have just been manipulated by a situation deepfake – an event that never actually happened. </p>

<p>Situation deepfakes represent the next stage of technologies that <a href=""https://theconversation.com/text-to-image-ai-powerful-easy-to-use-technology-for-making-art-and-fakes-195517"">have already</a> shaken audiences’ perceptions of reality. In our research at the <a href=""https://defake.app/about"">DeFake Project</a>, my colleagues at the <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=icDo19sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, the <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RRnoeFsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">University of Mississippi</a>, <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wXA8nb4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">Michigan State University</a> <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UxGWcUYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">and I</a> study how deepfakes are made and what measures voters can take to defend themselves from them. </p>

<h2>Imagining events that never happened</h2>

<p>A deepfake is created when someone uses an artificial intelligence tool, especially <a href=""https://theconversation.com/deep-learning-and-neural-networks-77259"">deep learning</a>, to manipulate or generate a <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/deepfake-ai-scammer-money-wiring-china-1850461160"">face</a>, a <a href=""https://theconversation.com/voice-deepfakes-are-calling-heres-what-they-are-and-how-to-avoid-getting-scammed-201449"">voice</a> or – with the rise of <a href=""https://theconversation.com/ai-to-z-all-the-terms-you-need-to-know-to-keep-up-in-the-ai-hype-age-203917"">large language models</a> like <a href=""https://techonomy.com/chatgpt-is-the-deepfake-of-thought/"">ChatGPT</a> – <a href=""https://techpolicy.press/assessing-the-risks-of-language-model-deepfakes-to-democracy/"">conversational language</a>. These can be combined to form “situation deepfakes.”</p>

<p>The basic idea and technology of a situation deepfake are the same as with any other deepfake, but with a bolder ambition: to manipulate a real event or invent one from thin air. Examples include depictions of <a href=""https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/status/1636401172742385671"">Donald Trump’s perp walk</a> and <a href=""https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/verify/ai/trump-hugging-fauci-photos-ron-desantis-shared-not-real/536-9be58e27-546e-467c-9243-b2e771c96cb8"">Trump hugging Anthony Fauci</a>, neither of which happened. The hug shot was promoted by a <a href=""https://twitter.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1665799058303188992"">Twitter account</a> <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/06/entertainment/peaky-blinders-ron-desantis/index.html"">associated with the presidential campaign</a> of Trump rival Ron DeSantis. An <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLMMxgtxQ1Y"">attack ad</a> targeting Joe Biden’s 2024 campaign published by the Republican National Committee was <a href=""https://www.thenationalnews.com/world/us-news/2023/04/25/republicans-issue-anti-biden-advert-made-entirely-with-ai/"">made entirely with AI</a>.</p>

<p>At the <a href=""https://defake.app/about"">DeFake Project</a>, our <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353523710_DeFaking_Deepfakes_Understanding_Journalists'_Needs_for_Deepfake_Detection"">research has found</a> that deepfakes, including situations, are typically created by some mixture of <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=%22face+swapping%22&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjC4PmSloSAAxUyEVkFHc2cBncQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=%22face+swapping%22"">adding one piece of media with another</a>; using a video <a href=""https://blog.metaphysic.ai/high-quality-deepfake-puppetry-in-thirty-seconds/"">to animate an image or alter another video</a>, dubbed puppeteering; conjuring a piece of media into existence, typically using <a href=""https://this-person-does-not-exist.com/en"">generative AI</a>; or some combination of these techniques.</p>

<p>To be clear, many situation deepfakes are made for innocent purposes. For example, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/infiniteodyssey.mag/"">Infinite Odyssey Magazine</a> produces fake stills from movies that <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Csn6K38oURn/"">were never produced</a> or <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3PU9iOBqm/"">could never have existed</a>. But even innocent deepfakes give reason for pause, as in the case of near-believable fake photographs depicting the <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp5qVHFuRId/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D"">Apollo Moon landing as a movie production</a>. </p>

<h2>Deepfaking an election</h2>

<p>Now put yourself in the position of someone trying to influence the upcoming election. What are the possible situations you might want to create? </p>

<p>For starters, it would matter whether you wanted to tilt voting toward or away from a specific outcome. Maybe you would portray a candidate acting heroically by pulling a pedestrian out of the way of a speeding car or, conversely, doing something offensive or criminal. The format of the situation deepfake would also matter. Instead of a video, it could be a photograph, maybe with the blur and angles that simulate a smartphone camera or the forged logo of a news agency. </p>

<p>Your target audience would be key. Rather than aiming for the general electorate or a party’s base, you might target conspiracy theorists in key voting districts. You could portray the candidate or their family members as engaging in a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thelandofpumpkins/posts/pfbid02oiyejDtu4jBDxXAtuuFsE8PPZrK9dwSvh2dRJAnUo6AEFq7jqzc4kmdq7hZarnjel"">satanic ritual</a>, participating in a festival at the <a href=""https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/what-is-bohemian-grove-the-secretive-sonoma-county-camp-visited-by-justice/"">exclusive and controversial</a> <a href=""https://neural.love/ai-art-generator/1ed941f7-f75d-6286-a539-0fe6b4116777/snapshot-of-bohemian-grove-moloch-statue-1970s-realistic-clear-focus-highly-detailed-kodak-35mm"">Bohemian Grove</a>, or having a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/comments/1204m3a/the_presidents_meet_the_aliens_throughout_the/"">secret meeting with an extraterrestrial</a>. </p>

<p>If you have the ambition and capabilities for it, you could even try to deepfake the election itself. In June 2023, Russia’s television and radio stations were hacked and <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/fake-vladimir-putin-announces-russia-under-attack-ukraine-war/"">broadcast a full mobilization order</a> by a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t14YaS30h-o"">deepfake of Russian President Vladimir Putin</a>. While this would be more difficult to do in a U.S. election, in principle any news outlet could be hacked to broadcast deepfakes of their anchors announcing the wrong results or a candidate conceding.</p>

<h2>Defending reality</h2>

<p>There are a variety of technological and psychological ways to detect and defend against situation deepfakes. </p>

<p>On the technological front, all deepfakes contain some evidence of their true nature. Some of these tells can by seen by the human eye – like overly smooth skin or odd lighting or architecture – while others may be <a href=""https://spectrum.ieee.org/deepfake"">detectable only by a deepfake-hunting AI</a>.</p>

<p>We are building <a href=""https://defake.app/"">DeFake</a>’s detector to use AI to catch the telltale signs of deepfakes, and we are working to try to have it ready in time for the 2024 election. But even if a sufficiently powerful deepfake detector like ours cannot be deployed by Election Day, there are psychological tools that you, the voter, can use to identify deepfakes: background knowledge, curiosity and healthy skepticism.</p>

<p>If you encounter media content about a person, place or event that seems uncharacteristic, trust your background knowledge. For example, in a <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/fake-picture-explosion-pentagon-spooks-twitter-rcna85659"">recent hoax of a fire at the Pentagon</a>, the building shown looks more square than pentagonal, which could be a giveaway. </p>

<p>However, try not to rely entirely on your background knowledge, which could be mistaken or patchy. Never be afraid to learn more from reliable sources, like fact-checked news reports, peer-reviewed academic articles or interviews with credentialed experts. </p>

<p>Additionally, be aware that deepfakes can be used to take advantage of what you are <a href=""https://theconversation.com/cognitive-biases-and-brain-biology-help-explain-why-facts-dont-change-minds-186530"">inclined to believe</a> about a person, place or event. One of the best ways to deal with this is to simply <a href=""https://www.mindtools.com/a0ozgex/cognitive-bias"">be aware of your biases</a> and be a bit guarded about any media content that seems to confirm them.</p>

<p>Even if it becomes possible to create perfect situation deepfakes, how believable their subject matter is, is likely to remain their Achilles’ heel. So, with or without a technological solution, you still have the power to defend the election from the influence of fake events.</p>

  <div class=""grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
    <p>When Brazil <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/americas/brazil-enacts-affirmative-action-law-for-universities.html"">implemented affirmative action</a> at its federal universities in 2012, the policy prompted a public debate that largely resembles the debate over affirmative action in the United States.</p>

<p>Brazil’s affirmative action policy requires every federal university to reserve at least half of all seats for students from certain groups. Out of that half, about half of the seats go solely to Black, mixed and Indigenous Brazilians. The other half go to low-income public-school students. Other universities are free to set their admissions policies. </p>

<p>Like many Americans, some Brazilians worried that affirmative action would <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/world/americas/brazil-enacts-affirmative-action-law-for-universities.html"">reduce the quality of education in public universities</a>. Some were concerned that only <a href=""https://www.scielo.br/j/op/a/QyKvRBhmPkKc5f8v7LHFWbg/?lang=pt"">the more privileged members in the targeted groups would benefit</a> and that affirmative action wasn’t worth it. Others doubted that beneficiaries could keep up academically and feared that their <a href=""https://ojs.ufgd.edu.br/index.php/movimentacao/article/viewFile/5113/3957"">peers would suffer</a> as a result.</p>

<p>As researchers who study <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ma37cqEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">college admissions</a>, <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V6FhDu4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"">economics</a> and the <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AfGX7nYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"">equity of social interventions and policies</a>, we took a critical look at the <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/joes.12564"">effects of affirmative action in Brazil</a>. To do this, we examined prior research, as well as the effects of affirmative action on student learning and future earnings. In America, these outcomes are difficult to study because, prior to the use of race being banned in college admissions, schools implemented affirmative action as they saw fit. In Brazil, all federal universities had to implement affirmative action the same way.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<h2>Unfounded fears</h2>

<p>Brazilian federal universities are some of the <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-has-tuition-free-college-but-it-only-serves-a-portion-of-its-citizens-2015-6"">best in the country</a>. Even more importantly, they are <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-has-tuition-free-college-but-it-only-serves-a-portion-of-its-citizens-2015-6"">tuition-free</a>. They are the <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/04/brazil-where-free-universities-largely-serve-the-wealthy/389997/"">preferred universities</a> for most high school students and their families. Historically, mostly well-off students attended these universities.</p>

<p>Through our research, we concluded not only that Brazilians’ fears about affirmative action lowering the quality of the nation’s universities were largely unwarranted, but also that across most measures the policy has <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/joes.12564"">proved to be quite beneficial</a>. </p>

<p>Specifically, we found that:</p>

<p>• Those admitted to universities via affirmative action performed quite well in their studies. By the time they graduated, their grade-point averages were not much different from the GPAs of other students. In the most selective majors, the disparities in GPAs that existed when students began their studies <a href=""https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/joes.12564"">had largely disappeared by graduation</a>. </p>

<p>• Students admitted through affirmative action <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3368/jhr.47.3.754"">did not hamper the learning of their peers</a>. Sometimes, they outperformed peers who entered college the regular way without affirmative action. This is a reminder that traditional admissions processes may not be as meritocratic as some people may think.</p>

<p>• Students admitted via affirmative action were <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.06.017"">7% more likely</a> to work as managers or directors later in their careers than if the policy were not in effect. Such students also end up with many more years of education than they would otherwise. This means that many of these students would not pursue a higher education degree at all if these places were not reserved for them.</p>

<h2>Implications for the United States</h2>

<p>As elite colleges and universities in the U.S. grapple with how to achieve diversity after the Supreme Court banned the use of race in college admissions, we believe our findings bear particular relevance.</p>

<p>Some Americans argue that schools can achieve diversity <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2023.104839"">through race-neutral policies</a>. At least in the Brazilian context, we found that race-neutral policies were <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/joes.12564"">ineffective for achieving racial diversity</a>.</p>

<p>We found that race-targeted policies were associated with a <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2019.101931"">significant increase in Black students</a>, whereas race-neutral policies didn’t affect the percentage of Black, mixed and Indigenous Brazilian students in college. Part of the reason is because a large share of candidates, white and nonwhite, compete under income-based quotas. Thus, income-based quotas do not effect the racial composition of university students because these quotas benefit students from all racial backgrounds.</p>

<p>Race-based affirmative action seems necessary to achieve racial diversity, according to the Brazilian evidence. This is consistent with at least one other study from the U.S., where race-neutral policies have been shown to be <a href=""https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20161290"">less effective than those explicitly considering race</a>. </p>

<p>By almost every measure studied, affirmative action in Brazil worked to generate a more diverse student body without reducing the quality of education. Even so, the inequality in Brazil’s higher education system remains. </p>

<p>In 2000, out of the 853,000 students enrolled in tuition-free public universities, around 596,000 were white and 239,000 were Black. By 2010, the system had expanded to 1,788,000 places, <a href=""https://www.scielo.br/j/cp/a/tttVNfkLTtGXpmB8JDFcdnD/?lang=pt#ModalFigf4"">with white students numbering 1,063,000 and Black students 689,000</a>. Brazil’s congress successfully made affirmative action mandatory in part because of the large impact of the many-but-scattered initiatives by public universities in the 2000s. </p>

<p>As the U.S. grapples with issues of equity and access to higher education, Brazil’s experience imparts valuable lessons. There, race-based affirmative action policies promote diversity and the values of equal opportunity that <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01339-1"">American universities like to espouse</a>. Race-based affirmative action can effectively increase enrollment of underrepresented minorities without compromising academic performance. This is something that income-based quotas may not be able to accomplish. Further, the Brazilian experience shows that these policies do not negatively impact other students.</p>

<p>Now that the U.S. courts have banned the use of race in college admissions, college and university leaders must find and adopt new ways to make their campuses more diverse. How to achieve that may be a challenge, but it seems to remain a worthwhile pursuit.</p>

    <p>Before Congress <a href=""https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/slave-trade.html"">ended the transatlantic slave trade</a> in 1808, the Port of Charleston was <a href=""https://www.postandcourier.com/news/special_reports/slavery-in-charleston-a-chronicle-of-human-bondage-in-the-holy-city/article_54334e04-4834-50b7-990b-f81fa3c2804a.html"">the nation’s epicenter</a> of human trafficking. </p>

<p>Almost half of the estimated 400,000 African people imported into what became the United States were brought to that Southern city, and <a href=""https://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/africanpassageslowcountryadapt/sectionii_introduction"">a substantial number</a> took their first steps on American soil at <a href=""https://www.preservationsociety.org/locations/gadsdens-wharf/"">Gadsden’s Wharf</a> on the Cooper River.</p>

<p>That location of once utter degradation is now the hallowed site of the <a href=""https://iaamuseum.org/"">International African American Museum</a>. Pronounced “I Am” and <a href=""https://www.postandcourier.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-charleston-celebrates-a-new-museum-a-new-day/article_316fd1e0-0fad-11ee-a08a-7b6f11f64bdc.html"">opened in June 2023</a>, the US$120 million project financed by state and local funds and private donations was 25 years in the making and is a memorial to not only those enslaved but also those whose lives as free Black Americans affected U.S. history and society through their fight for full citizenship rights. </p>

<p>As <a href=""https://asalh.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BIOGRAPHY-POWERS.pdf"">a historian</a> and founding director of the College of Charleston’s <a href=""https://studyslaverycharleston.cofc.edu/"">Center for the Study of Slavery</a> in Charleston, I served as the museum’s interim executive director and know firsthand how difficult the road has been to build a museum focused on African American history. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>The museum’s mission is to honor the untold stories of the African American journey and, by virtue of its location and landscape design, pay reverence to the ground on which it sits.</p>

<h2>America’s widespread historical illiteracy</h2>

<p>Many Americans don’t know much about the nation or its history. </p>

<p>In the 2022 “<a href=""https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/civics/2022/"">Nation’s Report Card</a>,” the National Assessment of Educational Progress revealed ongoing deficiencies in <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/05/03/history-civic-test-results-covid-schools"">eighth grade students’ knowledge</a> of U.S. history and civics. </p>

<p>Only 20% of test-takers scored proficient or above in civics, and, for American history, only 13% achieved proficiency.</p>

<p>The adult population shows similar deficits. </p>

<p>A 2018 <a href=""https://woodrow.org/news/american-history-report/"">Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation</a> survey shockingly revealed only <a href=""https://citizensandscholars.org/resource/national-survey-finds-just-1-in-3-americans-would-pass-citizenship-test/"">36% of people who were born in the U.S.</a> knew enough basic American history and government to pass the citizenship test.</p>

<p>And <a href=""https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/politics/woke-2024-gop-primary/67-ad81efcb-860c-4663-b04c-a06452961284"">conservative political candidates</a> are working to prevent current students from learning key information about the country’s founding and development by mischaracterizing the teaching of slavery and civil rights as <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05"">critical race theory</a>.  </p>

<p>Though critical race theory is typically taught in graduate and law schools, <a href=""https://www.chalkbeat.org/22525983/map-critical-race-theory-legislation-teaching-racism"">at least 36</a> states had banned or tried to ban lessons on Black history from public K-12 classrooms. </p>

<p>In this highly politicized environment, efforts to restrict how race can be discussed in public schools have led to <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/authors-color-speak-efforts-ban-books-race/story?id=81491208"">widespread calls from parents and politicians</a> for the censorship of certain books on race. </p>

<p>These new restrictions have had an impact on public education, according to the <a href=""https://ncheteach.org/post/How-do-we-Navigate-the-Culture-Wars-in-History-Classrooms-this-Year"">National Council for History Education</a>. </p>

<p>A <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-3.html"">2022 survey of teachers</a> conducted by the <a href=""https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-7.html"">Rand Corp.</a> showed the restrictions “influenced their choice of curriculum materials or instructional practices,” as many “chose to or were directed to omit the use of certain materials” deemed “controversial or potentially offensive.”</p>

<h2>South Carolinians’ overlooked national impact</h2>

<p>One of the first things visitors see at the museum is an <a href=""https://iaamuseum.org/building-and-garden/"">African Ancestors Memorial Garden</a>, which includes a graphic stone relief depicting <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p277.html"">captive Africans during the Middle Passage</a>.</p>

<p>But the museum is not just a memorial site of enslavement. </p>

<p>Exhibits show how the lives of Black people and their resistance to enslavement helped shape state, national and international affairs.</p>

<p>For example, South Carolina’s 1739 <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part1/1p284.html"">Stono Rebellion</a>, in which fugitive slaves attempted to escape to Spanish Florida, precipitated conflict between Spain and Great Britain. </p>

<p>Many Americans know about white abolitionist <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/articles/john-browns-raid.htm"">John Brown’s 1859 attack</a> against the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, which led to the Civil War. </p>

<p>But few know that <a href=""https://nyupress.org/9781479802753/the-untold-story-of-shields-green/"">Shields Green</a>, a South Carolina fugitive slave, assisted in the planning and execution of the fateful attack.</p>

<p>Even fewer know of <a href=""https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv2cxx8zq"">South Carolina’s role</a> in the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>Many know the name Rosa Parks, but it was Charleston’s educator and activist <a href=""https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/clark-septima-poinsette"">Septima Clark</a> who inspired Parks and led the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern educational and voting rights initiatives. </p>

<p>In fact, King <a href=""https://avery.cofc.edu/the-legacy-of-septima-p-clark-by-kangkang-kovacs/"">once called Clark</a> “the mother of the movement” and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/09612029900200193"">considered her to be</a> a  “community teacher, an intuitive fighter for human rights and leader of her unlettered and disillusioned people.”</p>

<h2>A monument to freedom</h2>

<p>The museum’s educational goals are ambitious. </p>

<p>It is an interdisciplinary history museum, where educators plan to work with teachers and administrators around the world to make sure students in American schools – and everyone who lives in the U.S. today and in the future – learns about South Carolina’s significant role in U.S. history. </p>

<p>In my view, that collaboration will likely be challenging, given the efforts to sanitize the nation’s racial history and teachers’ apprehensions about teaching supposedly controversial subjects. </p>

<p>“This is a site of trauma,” Tonya Matthews, CEO and president of the museum, <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/international-african-american-museum-charleston-south-carolina-trauma-triumph/"">told CBS News</a>. “But look who’s standing here now. That’s what makes it a site of joy, and triumph.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the International African American museum is, by design, a monument to freedom – and an honest engagement with America’s troubled racial past.</p>

    <p>Democrats in Congress are making a new push to get the long-dormant proposed Equal Rights Amendment enshrined into law. As legislation, it would guarantee sex equality in the Constitution and could serve as a potential legal antidote to the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf"">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, which removed the federal right to an abortion. </p>

<p>“In light of Dobbs, we’re seeing vast discrimination across the country,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/democrats-equal-rights-amendment.html"">said U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand</a> of New York in an interview July 13, 2023. “Women are being treated as second-class citizens. This is more timely than ever.”</p>

<p>Gillibrand, U.S. Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri and other Democratic lawmakers are arguing that the Equal Rights Amendment, often referred to as the ERA, has already been ratified by the states and is <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/democrats-equal-rights-amendment.html"">enforceable </a> as the 28th Amendment to the Constitution. </p>

<p>Efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution to recognize women’s rights have faced major challenges for the past century. Most recently, in April 2023 Senate Republicans <a href=""https://www.rollcall.com/2023/04/27/senate-gop-blocks-resolution-nixing-equal-rights-amendment-ratification-deadline/"">blocked a similar resolution</a> that would let states ratify the amendment, despite an expired deadline. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>I’m a scholar who <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/sociology/political-sociology/abortion-politics-mass-media-and-social-movements-america?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781107069237"">studies gender</a> and <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2329496515603726?casa_token=4HXIJlECyQQAAAAA%3AY9b0XOGxgif8EinuzkdxBcW53F80hF0khTztRdnu3Kx6DxC5I0_Nou7RiY8K3KsLxdIk6QgaxWyb"">politics</a>. Here’s a quick summary of how the country got to this point and the barriers that still exist to adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.</p>

<h2>‘Ladies against women’</h2>

<p>Women’s rights advocates argue that sex discrimination is a pervasive problem that could be resolved by the ERA. Even though the Equal Protection Clause in the <a href=""https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/14thamendment.html"">14th Amendment</a> prohibits states from denying any person equal protection under the law, women’s rights are not explicitly guaranteed.</p>

<p>In the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which took away a woman’s right to an abortion, women’s rights advocates argue that the ERA is critical in the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/democrats-equal-rights-amendment.html"">post-Dobbs</a> world. The amendment could help protect women’s access to reproductive health services, including abortion and contraception. </p>

<p>Proponents also believe that the ERA can be used to push back against legislation that <a href=""https://www.advocate.com/commentary/2022/3/22/why-passing-era-critical-lgbtq-folks-equality-act"">threatens the rights of LGBTQ+ people</a>. </p>

<p>The push for equal rights first heated up in the 1920s after women gained the right to vote. </p>

<p><a href=""https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/012280242"">Alice Paul</a>, a suffragist, proposed the first version of an Equal Rights Amendment in 1923. The <a href=""https://www.archives.gov/women/era"">language of the legislation</a>, which is very similar to the amendment Democrats are currently championing, guaranteed equal rights under the law, regardless of a person’s sex. </p>

<p>The proposal was adopted and turned into proposed legislation by two Kansas Republicans, Sen. Charles Curtis and Rep. Daniel Anthony Jr., and was brought up during every congressional session between 1923 and 1971 without success.</p>

<p>The idea of an Equal Rights Amendment, however, gained momentum among politicians and the broader public. <a href=""https://bepl.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/default/search/detailnonmodal/ent:%24002f%24002fSD_ILS%24002f0%24002fSD_ILS:316728/ada"">World War II</a> opened many doors for women, who filled gaps in the labor force while men were off fighting. During this time, women were welcomed into politics, onto juries, openly wooed by educational institutions and encouraged to take up male-dominated majors such as math, science and technology.</p>

<p>The fledgling feminist group, the <a href=""http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100290360"">National Organization for Women</a>, adopted the passage of the ERA in its 1967 Bill of Rights for Women and began staging massive demonstrations and lobbying politicians in the late 1960s and early 1970s in an effort to get Congress to pass the amendment. </p>

<p>Finally, <a href=""https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42979.pdf"">in 1972</a>, the ERA passed both houses of Congress. The amendment had seven years to be ratified by three-fourths, or 38, of the 50 states.</p>

<p>While 30 states ratified the ERA in 1972 and 1973, the amendment ultimately came up three states short of approval by the 1979 deadline. </p>

<p>This was in large part due to the <a href=""https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo5977742.html"">efforts of conservative</a> women’s organizations <a href=""https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/sociology/political-sociology/abortion-politics-mass-media-and-social-movements-america?format=HB&amp;isbn=9781107069237"">opposed it</a>. Conservative women <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/socpro/article-abstract/32/4/348/1734706"">said that the ERA</a> was a <a href=""https://theconversation.com/could-the-era-pass-in-the-metoo-era-87901"">threat</a> to family and child-rearing, because it would disrupt traditional gender roles. They also believed women would lose, among other things, their exemptions from the draft and combat duty.</p>

<p>At the same time, for a number of reasons, <a href=""https://history.nebraska.gov/blog/nebraskas-again-again-relationship-equal-rights-amendment"">Nebraska</a>, Tennessee, Idaho, South Dakota and Kentucky rescinded their ERA ratifications between 1972 and 1982. Some state legislators argued that the amendment was <a href=""https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo5977742.html"">too controversial</a> given its potential to upend traditional gender roles and legalize what they called “abortion on demand.”</p>

<p>States such as Illinois and Florida became battlegrounds for liberal and conservative women fighting over the amendment. Feminists successfully lobbied Congress to extend the ERA’s ratification deadline to June 30, 1982. The ERA, however, was not ratified by the three states needed to ensure its passage. In 1982, conservative women proclaimed the Equal Rights Amendment officially dead. </p>

<p>In 2023, conservative women’s groups like the Eagle Forum and Concerned Women for America continue to make the same arguments against the ERA. Instead of focusing on the battlefield, however, the groups argue that the ERA will <a href=""https://eagleforum.org/topics/era.html"">eliminate restrictions on abortion</a> and erase “<a href=""https://concernedwomen.org/dont-erase-women-with-an-equal-rights-amendment/"">women-only safe spaces</a>” like bathrooms and locker rooms.</p>

<h2>Another chance?</h2>

<p>Since 2017, three more states – <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/01/15/796754345/virginia-ratifies-the-equal-rights-amendment-decades-after-deadline"">Nevada, Illinois and Virginia</a> – have ratified the Equal Rights Amendment, bringing the total to 38 states, which is the  number required to ratify the ERA and officially make it the 28th Amendment. That is why Democrats believe they have legal standing.   </p>

<p>Some constitutional experts see Democrats’ latest attempt to codify the ERA as a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/democrats-equal-rights-amendment.html"">political stunt</a> rather than a legitimate legal move. To some extent, I think this may be true.</p>

<p>More than a dozen states have <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-level-equal-rights-amendments"">ERA equivalents</a> that protect women’s equal rights in their constitutions. And four states, including <a href=""https://www.wxxinews.org/capitol-bureau/2023-01-24/new-york-legislature-moves-on-equal-rights-amendment-that-includes-abortion-rights-protections"">New York</a>, have active ERA initiatives.</p>

<p>The current push for Democrats to pass the ERA seems to be largely about advocating for <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/05/11/abortion-choice-roe-dodds-confrontation/"">abortion access</a> and <a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4052425-supeme-court-abortion-democrats-political-gift-elections/"">mobilizing abortion rights supporters</a> ahead of the 2024 presidential election. </p>

<p>About half of the states across the U.S. have enacted restrictive abortion laws over the last year, with some <a href=""https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/texas/abortion-policies"">states</a> banning the procedure altogether. State ERA efforts, like the one in New York, are <a href=""https://www.wxxinews.org/capitol-bureau/2023-01-24/new-york-legislature-moves-on-equal-rights-amendment-that-includes-abortion-rights-protections"">a response</a> to these bans. </p>

<p>The renewed push for the ERA makes the fight over abortion access, once again, a national battle. In the current polarized political environment, abortion access promises to serve as a political lightening rod in coming years. </p>

    <p>When mercenary chief <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wagner-group-who-is-yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-mercenary-private-military-company/"">Yevgeny Prigozhin</a> led his rebels in a short-lived mutiny, many observers focused on how it would challenge the Kremlin politically – few looked at how the episode and the reaction of the Russian authorities <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/russia-prigozhin-wagner-mutiny-ukraine-putin-898d750e843aeb105a3c220bb917f606"">undermine the country’s legal system</a>.</p>

<p>On June 24, 2023, as the Wagner Group looked set to march on Moscow, the Russian Federal Security Bureau <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/23/wagner-chief-accuses-russias-military-of-attack-and-says-evil-leadership-must-be-stopped"">officially announced</a> the opening of an investigation under Article 279 of the Criminal Code, which prosecutes armed mutiny.</p>

<p>The crime is a particularly grave one under <a href=""https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/fceb931af1d53a0da76eca119394fed15d8a0b26/"">the Russian Criminal Code</a>, punishable by imprisonment ranging from 12 to 20 years.</p>

<p>Yet just a few hours after being opened, the case was closed. As a <a href=""https://www.politico.eu/article/wagner-group-russia-forces-turn-back-moscow-prigozhin-declares/"">result of negotiations</a>, Prigozhin ended the march some 200 kilometers (124 miles) short of Moscow. In return, the investigation into the rebels’ actions was dropped, and Prigozhin himself was granted passage to Belarus. The criminal case was <a href=""https://www.lemonde.fr/en/russia/article/2023/06/27/russia-drops-charges-against-wagner-mutineers_6038223_140.html"">officially dropped</a> on June 27 in an announcement by the Federal Security Bureau.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Russia has long <a href=""https://freedomhouse.org/country/russia/freedom-world/2023"">lost its status</a> as a state governed by the rule of law. Since the invasion of Ukraine, it has been accused of <a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/un-ukraine-massive-human-rights-violations-russia-war/"">massive human rights violations</a> and the <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/07/russia-un-experts-condemn-civil-society-shutdown"">systematic repression of human rights defenders</a> and opposition activists.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the dropping of the criminal case against Prigozhin and his mercenaries is unprecedented – especially given the perceived threat to the Russian state, the destruction of military equipment and the <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/russian-defense-minister-makes-first-public-appearance-since-mercenary-revolt-as-uncertainty-still-swirls"">deaths of some 15 Russian troops</a>. As someone who has been <a href=""https://sites.tufts.edu/fletcherrussia/the-russia-and-eurasia-program-welcomes-new-visiting-scholar-maxim-krupskiy/"">involved in the Russian legal system</a> for more than 12 years, as an attorney and a scholar of law, it is the first time I have heard of the dismissal of a criminal case involving such a massive violation of the law. It also runs counter to the experience of others in Russia who have been <a href=""https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-antiwar-activist-sentenced-ukraine/32415810.html"">imprisoned for many years</a> for <a href=""https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/russia-protesters-arrested-putin-documentary-excerpt-ukraine-war/"">expressing anti-war sentiment</a> in public.</p>

<h2>Undermining Putinism</h2>

<p>Russia under Vladimir Putin has increasingly employed repressive legal practices under the guise of protecting national security. Indeed, Putin at first tried to use the weight of the Russian legal system to pressure the Wagner Group to abandon its march on Moscow. The Russian president promised that all those responsible would be punished and referred to their <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/24/putin-vows-to-punish-those-involved-in-mutiny-accuses-them-of-treason.html"">actions as “treason</a>.” </p>

<p>Since “<a href=""https://warsawinstitute.org/state-duma-adopts-harsher-treason-penalties/"">treason” under the Russian Criminal Code</a> refers to those defecting to an enemy, such a charge was not applicable. Instead, criminal proceedings were opened under the article on armed mutiny. Nonetheless, Putin initially sent a clear signal that Prigozhin’s actions were seen not only as a very serious crime that would be treated as such but as “<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/24/putin-vows-to-punish-those-involved-in-mutiny-accuses-them-of-treason.html"">a deadly threat</a>” to Russian statehood and the nation.</p>

<p>The failure to carry through with such rhetoric undermines Putin’s long-cultivated image as someone who refuses to negotiate with criminals when given an ultimatum. It is, to my knowledge, the first public example of Putin breaking his own rule against negotiating with those who challenge his regime. Such a policy has been Putin’s default ever since he came to power. Then, with the backdrop of <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/03/12/1085861999/russias-wars-in-chechnya-offer-a-grim-warning-of-what-could-be-in-ukraine"">war in Chechnya</a>, Russia faced a large number of terrorist attacks. Rather than negotiate, Putin would pursue a policy of destroying those attacking the Russian state – even at the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39586814"">heavy cost of hostages’ lives</a>. That image of a man who will not negotiate has now been shattered.</p>

<h2>‘Erosion of the legal system’</h2>

<p>But the damage goes beyond denting Putin’s reputation – it also undermines Russia’s legal system itself. As St. Petersburg municipal council member Nikita Yuferev noted in the aftermath of the episode, the <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/russia-prigozhin-wagner-mutiny-ukraine-putin-898d750e843aeb105a3c220bb917f606"">dropping of the criminal case represents</a> the “gradual erosion of the legal system” in Russia.</p>

<p>In terms of Russian law, the Federal Security Bureau has presented nothing in the way of sound legal justification for dropping the criminal case against Prigozhin or the Wagner Group. It could have dismissed the case if the acts committed by the Wagner Group were not deemed to be mutinous or if the people involved in organizing and participating in it had died.</p>

<p>But in dropping the criminal case, the bureau <a href=""https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/06/27/fsb-says-closed-criminal-mutiny-case-against-prigozhin-a81658"">merely offered</a> that the rebels had “ceased their actions aimed at committing a crime.” From a legal standpoint, this looks extremely unconvincing. The Wagner Group seized several cities, including the headquarters of the Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, and killed several Russian military personnel by the time it announced the end of its march on Moscow.</p>

<p>That the Russian authorities have so far failed to come up with any legal justification for dropping the case marks a departure from past precedent. As a rule, Putin has sought to shroud his actions in at least quasi-legal reasoning. </p>

<p>Take, for example, <a href=""https://www.rferl.org/a/moscow-official-kherson-referendum-postponed/32019315.html"">Russia’s annexation</a> of the eastern territories of Ukraine. In order to give the annexation the appearance of legality, authorities organized referendums in the occupied territories and presented the annexation as being the result of the free expression of will. <a href=""https://theins.ru/en/news/262795"">Recent rulings</a> by Russia’s Constitutional Court against people who criticize Russian aggression against Ukraine, along with <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/01/russia-new-restrictions-foreign-agents"">legislation on “foreign agents</a>,” also provide evidence of how Putin uses quasi-legal tools for political ends.</p>

<p>Indeed, the whole Wagner Group episode, from its deployment in Ukraine to its leader’s negotiated exile, recalls the “wild 1990s” in Russia, a post-Soviet decade in which politics and organized crime went hand in hand. </p>

<p>Under the <a href=""https://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/a9e28227f557dc1e6659c1d88613790bb3dddb5b/"">Russian Criminal Code</a>, being part of a mercenary group is a crime. So too is the financing and other material support of mercenaries, punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 years. The state is prohibited from funding mercenary activities – something that raises legal questions over the financing of Prigozhin’s private army in Ukraine in the first place.</p>

<h2>Laws not written in stone</h2>

<p>The treatment of Prigozhin also contrasts with the experience and the use of law against other Russians. While Prigozhin avoided charges despite directly challenging the Russian state – and decrying Moscow’s military progress in Ukraine – many others have been imprisoned for simply speaking out against the conflict.</p>

<p>In the opening days of the February 2022 invasion, it became a <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-introduce-jail-terms-spreading-fake-information-about-army-2022-03-04/"">criminal offense in Russia</a> to spread “false information” or “discredit” the Russian army. The vaguely worded law has made possible the large-scale political persecution of Russian citizens with anti-war views. Since then, the <a href=""https://en.ovdinfo.org/discreditation-articles-explainer"">state has initiated</a> <a href=""https://www.svoboda.org/a/sroki-sopostavimye-so-srokami-za-ubiystvo-dela-o-feykah-pro-armiyu/32310199.html"">more than 150</a> criminal cases under the article on spreading “fake news” about the Russian army, 89 criminal cases on “discrediting” the Russian army and 7,182 administrative cases.</p>

<p>The idea that the rule of law can be used for political ends – be it to finance a private army, dismiss charges against such groups or used to suppress anti-war sentiment – is something that has been actively promoted by some Russian propagandists. For example, the editor in chief of state-controlled broadcaster RT, Margarita Simonyan, said of the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/a6fb9f42-f17b-4d1f-9298-6eb0eed35e86"">decision to drop charges</a> in regard to the Prigozhin armed mutiny: “Legal norms are not the commandments of Christ or the tablets of Moses.” In other words, if necessary they can be ignored.</p>

<p>This public dismissal of law as the main regulator of social relations, and its replacement by agreements to settle criminal disputes, indicates a new stage of degradation of the Russian legal system. I fear it will give Russian authorities even more discretion and will entail a new round of repression inside the country.</p>

    <p>As a mama trying to raise a daughter free from the gendered stereotypes of my own childhood, I steered her clear of Barbie dolls.</p>

<p>I felt compelled to nudge my now 11-year-old away from the Mattel mainstay for the same reasons I tried to avoid the shallow frivolity of all those Disney princesses waiting around to be rescued.</p>

<p>True, I’d enjoyed plenty of afternoons with these dolls of anatomically impossible proportions myself as a kid growing up in the 1980s – jamming those long spindly limbs into impossibly tiny outfits, scissoring them on mattresses fashioned from my mother’s maxi pads, staging epic domestic dramas. But by the time I was a teenager in the 1990s, I’d discovered feminism.</p>

<p>I’d later grow up to become <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A3xkVSMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">a professor of feminist philosophy</a> and the author of a <a href=""https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324003090"">book on feminism</a> for the general public. Barbie’s hyperbolic blond femininity came to represent everything that was wrong with <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/standard-issues-white-supremacy-capitalism-influence-beauty"">patriarchal beauty standards</a>. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>My perspective began to change when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBk4NYhWNMM&amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures"">snippets of the “Barbie” movie trailer</a> started insinuating themselves into my online feeds. Hot pink hot flashes of nostalgia merged with the realization that Barbie looks to be reinventing herself once again.</p>

<h2>Barbie’s retrograde femininity</h2>

<p>I think Barbie has long functioned as a proxy onto which cultural aspirations and anxieties about womanhood are projected.</p>

<p>The toy first <a href=""http://www.barbiemedia.com/timeline.html"">hit the market in 1959</a>. To earlier generations, as the first doll to encourage girls to aspire to anything other than motherhood, Barbie might have stood for the unapologetic ambitiousness of the independent career woman. But when it was my generation’s time to play with her, she’d long since been drained of anything so progressive. </p>

<p>Instead, there was the relentless whiteness of her <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90457388/barbies-latest-dolls-are-bald-and-have-vitiligo"">ideal of beauty</a>. The class-obliviousness of her <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/06/23/realestate/barbie-dreamhouse.html"">McMansion Dreamhouse</a>. Her protestations that “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO0cvqT1tAE"">Math class is tough</a>,” driving home the message that STEM is for boys and that girls should be more concerned with being pretty than being smart, or happy, or ambitious or interesting.</p>

<figure>
            <div class=""placeholder-container"" style=""--aspect-ratio-percent:56.25%;--background-color:#fff""><iframe class=""lazyload"" data-src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NO0cvqT1tAE?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0"" allowfullscreen="""" width=""100%"" height=""400"" frameborder=""0""></iframe></div>
            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">Mattel’s ‘Teen Talk’ Barbie uttered phrases like ‘Math class is tough’ and ‘Do you have a crush on anyone?’</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>All this made Barbie an extremely convenient whipping girl for legitimate frustrations about the unfair expectations foisted onto women by a patriarchal society. Like many feminists, I came to believe that being taken seriously as a woman meant rejecting pretty much everything that Barbie stood for.  </p>

<p>My ambivalence toward the kind of conventional femininity of which Barbie was the apotheosis came to feel like a central component of my identity. Sure, I might’ve felt naked if I’d left the house without wearing makeup and uncomfortably restrictive clothing. But I felt consistently guilty about the time and energy I let myself dump into such frivolous pursuits, and I made sure to hide as much of it as I could from my growing daughter. </p>

<p>If I was going to indulge in superficialities that felt completely at odds with my ideological commitments, at least I was going to protect her from internalizing the conviction that she needed to do the same.  </p>

<p>No daughter of mine was going have her self-worth tied to the belief that she needs to be sexually appealing to men. So: no Barbies.</p>

<h2>Femmephobia</h2>

<p>Then the hype surrounding the movie strutted those perfectly arched plastic feet back into my consciousness, and I found myself reconsidering my long-standing aversion to Barbie’s performance of femininity. Why, I wondered, did she bring out such mean-girl energy in me? </p>

<p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-020-01641-x"">Femmephobia refers</a> to the dislike of, or hostility toward, people or qualities that are stereotypically feminine. It arises against a cultural backdrop in which femininity is consistently less valued than masculinity, and in which the traits associated with masculinity – rationality and independence – are considered to be normal or ideal for all people. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, qualities associated with femininity – such as emotional expressiveness and interdependence – are thought of as inferior, substandard or deviant. But it’s not as if feminine interests and pursuits are inherently more frivolous than masculine ones. Instead, it’s the very fact that something is coded as feminine that makes people take it less seriously.  </p>

<p>“Fashion,” <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/opinion/sunday/feminism-lean-in.html"">quips author Ruth Whippman</a>, “is vain and shallow, while baseball is basically a branch of philosophy.” And Barbie’s defiantly bubbly femininity is about as unserious as it comes.</p>

<p>The trans feminist author <a href=""https://www.juliaserano.com/"">Julia Serano</a> argues that much of the discrimination faced by trans women has less to do with their being trans and more to do with their being willing to brazenly perform femininity.  </p>

<p>The problem, in other words, is less about trans women transgressing conventional gender norms than about their picking the losing team.</p>

<p>“The fact that we identify and live as women, despite being born male and having inherited male privilege,” <a href=""https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/julia-serano/whipping-girl/9781580056229/?lens=seal-press"">she writes</a>, “challenges those in our society who wish to glorify maleness and masculinity.”</p>

<p>Today’s mainstream visibility of trans women has played an important role in advancing the cultural conversation about the respectability of femininity. Some <a href=""https://kathleenstock.substack.com/p/pride?s=r"">anti-trans critics</a> accuse the unapologetic femininity of trans women of entrenching retrograde stereotypes.  Their femmephobia seems to prevent them from realizing that the objects of their scorn could be celebrating femininity, not denigrating it.  </p>

<h2>Is ‘Barbie’ feminist?</h2>

<p>Mattel Films is <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/06/is-barbie-a-feminist-movie-depends-on-who-you-ask"">shying away from calling the “Barbie” movie “feminist</a>” – which is unsurprising, given the sometimes controversial label’s uncomfortable fit with corporate profit motives.</p>

<p>But the studio’s choice of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1950086/"">Greta Gerwig</a> to write and direct the film suggests a willingness to explore Barbie’s world through a political lens: <a href=""https://theconversation.com/more-than-mumblecore-and-bigger-than-barbie-who-is-greta-gerwig-209389"">Gerwig’s solid feminist credentials</a> include her 2017 “Lady Bird” and her 2019 adaptation of “Little Women.” And the casting in “Barbie” of lesbian icon <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0571952/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_q_kate%2520mcki"">Kate McKinnon</a> and trans model and actor <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6341515/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"">Hari Nef</a> is a clear nod to the LGBTQ+ community. </p>

<p>The feminist philosopher Judith Butler argues that <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/Gender-Trouble-Feminism-and-the-Subversion-of-Identity/Butler/p/book/9780415389556"">gender isn’t some deeply rooted metaphysical fact</a>; it’s something people perform via their mannerisms, clothing and behavior. Butler says everyone could stand to take a lesson from drag queens, who understand that there’s nothing fundamental behind the smoke and mirrors, nothing to gender above and beyond what the audience thinks of the show. In the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72AAlCa1Nko"">words of RuPaul</a>, perhaps the most famous drag queen of all: “You’re born naked, and the rest is drag.”  </p>

<p>I think Gerwig’s “Barbie” gets that memo. The hyperbolic femininity of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3053338/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_5_nm_3_q_margot%2520robb"">Margot Robbie’s portrayal of the iconic doll</a> strikes me as tantalizingly closer to <a href=""https://www.press.umich.edu/11694/camp"">queer camp</a> than as anything that’s supposed to be taken as a sincere role model.</p>

<h2>Barbie in the zeitgeist</h2>

<p>“Barbie” feels poised to tap into our current cultural moment, one in which conservative anti-feminist backlash is fueling the backsliding of generations of feminist gains. Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ people face unprecedented levels of both <a href=""https://glaad.org/glaads-2021-2022-where-we-are-tv-report-lgbtq-representation-reaches-new-record-highs/"">visibility</a> and <a href=""https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/violent-victimization-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-2017-2020"">violence</a>. The world’s having new cultural conversations about gender and sexuality.</p>

<p>Since coming out as queer several years ago, I have seen my relationship with my own femininity become considerably less fraught. Thanks in large part to the insights of feminists like Serano and Butler, I’m coming around to the recognition that performances of femininity can exist for purposes other than snagging a man.  </p>

<p>I won’t pretend to have completely broken free from my decades of internalized femmephobia. But when “Barbie” gets to my local movie theater, you’d better believe that my daughter and I will be first in line.</p>

    <p>Some of Hollywood’s top stars are <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-actors-writers-strike-1da6262b2506d64822201d53e5d76c43"">joining screenwriters on the picket line</a> after the main U.S. actors union voted to take part in an ongoing strike.</p>

<p>SAG-AFTRA, which represents more than 150,000 screen and stage actors, announced on July 13, 2023, that its <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/actors-strike-why.html"">members would go on strike</a>. </p>

<p>In so doing, they join members of the Writers Guild of America who have been on strike for several weeks. </p>

<p>Battles between Hollywood unions and the studios have <a href=""https://laist.com/news/la-history/hollywood-strike-1945-unions-iatse-bloody-friday"">taken place since the 1940s</a>. But this is the first time since the Eisenhower administration that the two major Hollywood unions have been on strike at the same time. The action – sparked by a long-running dispute over pay and greater protection against use of artificial intelligence and the rise of streaming services like Netflix – has shut down productions and become increasingly acrimonious. One Hollywood source <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/07/studios-allegedly-wont-end-strike-til-writers-start-losing-their-apartments"">told a reporter</a> that the studios want these strikes to “drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses.” </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>The strikes come at a time when polls suggest <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/354455/approval-labor-unions-highest-point-1965.aspx"">unions are more popular in the U.S. than at any time since 1965</a>, and the labor movement is experiencing a resurgence of organizing.</p>

<p>Since the mid-1900s, Hollywood studios have depicted the collective efforts of working people to improve their lives and gain a voice in their workplaces and the larger society with both sympathy and hostility.  Independent producers, who gained a foothold starting in the 1970s, have generally been friendlier toward workers and their unions.   </p>

<p>Some of the most well-known labor movies champion the struggle of the everyday worker: “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0027977/"">Modern Times</a>,” released in 1936, stars Charlie Chaplin going crazy due to his job on an assembly line. It features the famous image of Chaplin caught in the gears of factory machinery. “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032551/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">The Grapes of Wrath</a>,” a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck’s novel, tells the story of sharecropper Tom Joad’s radicalization after his family and other migrant workers experience destitute conditions in California’s growing fields and overcrowded migrant camps. </p>

<p>1979’s “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079638/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">Norma Rae</a>” is based on the life of <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/us/15sutton.html"">Crystal Lee Sutton</a>, who worked in a J.P. Stevens mill in North Carolina. The textile worker and single mom inspires her fellow workers to overcome their racial animus and work together to vote in a union. “<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212826/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">Bread and Roses</a>,” a 2000 film about low-wage janitors in Los Angeles, is based on the Service Employees International Union’s <a href=""https://www.labor.ucla.edu/what-we-do/research-tools/campaigns-and-research/justice-for-janitors/"">Justice for Janitors</a> movement.</p>

<p>There’s also an anti-labor strain of Hollywood history, particularly during <a href=""https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691153964/the-second-red-scare-and-the-unmaking-of-the-new-deal-left"">the post-World War II Red Scare</a>, when studios purged left-wing writers, directors and actors through <a href=""https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/hollywoods-red-scare-spread-stigma-association"">an industrywide blacklist</a>. Red Scare-era releases such as 1952’s “Big Jim McLain” and the 1954 film “On the Waterfront” often depicted unions as corrupt or infiltrated by communist subversives.</p>

<p>When I teach labor history, I’ve used films to supplement books and articles. I’ve found that students more easily grasp the human dimensions of workers’ lives and struggles when they are depicted on the screen. </p>

<p>Here are five unsung labor movies, all based on real-life events, that, in my view, deserve more attention. </p>

<h2>1. ‘<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078008/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_6"">Northern Lights</a>’ (1978)</h2>

<p>This is a fictionalized account of a fascinating but little-known political movement: <a href=""https://www.history.nd.gov/ndhistory/npl.html"">the Non-Partisan League</a>, which organized farmers in the upper Midwest in the early 1900s. </p>

<p>During this period, Midwestern farmers worked long hours to harvest grain that they were then forced to sell for low prices to elevators, while paying high prices to the big railroad companies and banks. Economic insecurity was a part of life, and foreclosures were routine. </p>

<p>The film follows Ray Sorenson, a young farmer influenced by socialist ideas who leaves his North Dakota farm to become a Non-Partisan League organizer. In his beat-up Model T, he travels the back roads, talking to farmers in their fields or around the potbellied stoves of country stores. He eventually persuades skeptical farmers that electing NPL candidates could get the government to create cooperative grain elevators, state-chartered banks with farmers as stockholders, and limits on the prices that railroads can charge farmers to haul their wheat. </p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">‘Northern Lights’ is based on an early-20th-century farmer-led political uprising in the Midwest.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>In 1916, the Non-Partisan League did, in fact, elect farmer <a href=""https://www.history.nd.gov/exhibits/governors/governors12.html"">Lynn Frazier</a> as governor of North Dakota with 79% of the vote. Two years later, the NPL won control of both houses of the state legislature and created the North Dakota Mill, still the only state-owned flour mill, and the <a href=""https://ilsr.org/rule/bank-of-north-dakota-2/"">The Bank of North Dakota</a>, which remains the nation’s only government-owned general-service bank.</p>

<h2>2. ‘<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033533/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">The Devil and Miss Jones</a>’ (1941)</h2>

<p>In this screwball comedy with a pro-union twist, Charles Coburn plays John P. Merrick, a fictional New York City department store owner.</p>

<p>After his employees hang him in effigy, the tycoon goes undercover to ferret out the agitators of a union drive led by a store clerk in the shoe department and a union organizer. </p>

<p>As he learns more about their lives, Merrick grows sympathetic to his workers – and even falls in love with one of his employees – none of whom know his true identity. As the workers prepare to go on strike, and even picket his house, Merrick reveals that he owns the store and agrees to their demands over pay and hours – and even marries the employee he’s fallen for. </p>

<p>The film was likely inspired by <a href=""http://msr-archives.rutgers.edu/archives/Issue%2016/essays/Opler.htm"">the 1937 sit-down strikes</a> by employees of New York City’s department stores. </p>

<h2>3. 'Salt of the Earth’ (1954)</h2>

<p>Decades ahead of its time, this story of New Mexico mine workers deals with issues of racism, sexism and class.</p>

<p>After a mine accident, the Mexican-American workers decide to strike. They demand better safety standards and equal treatment, since white miners are allowed to work in pairs, while Mexican ones are forced to work alone. The strikers expect the women to stay at home, cook and take care of the children. But when the company gets an injunction to end the men’s protest, the women step up and maintain the picket lines, earning greater respect from the men.</p>

<p>Made at the height of the Red Scare, the film’s writer, producer and director <a href=""https://www.highonfilms.com/salt-of-the-earth-1954-essay/"">had been blacklisted</a> for their leftist sympathies, so the film was sponsored by the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, not a Hollywood studio. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002095/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">Will Geer</a>, a blacklisted actor who later portrayed Grandpa Walton on the TV drama “The Waltons,” played the repressive sheriff. Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas played the leader of the wives. The other characters were portrayed by real miners and their wives who participated in the strike against <a href=""https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/empire-zinc-strike/"">the Empire Zinc Company</a>, which served as the inspiration for the film. </p>

<p>The film itself was blacklisted, and no major theater chain would show it, but has since become a cult favorite among union activists and on college campuses.</p>

<h2>4. ‘<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280377/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"">10,000 Black Men Named George</a>’ (2002)</h2>

<p>Andre Braugher stars as <a href=""https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-people/asa-philip-randolph"">A. Philip Randolph</a>, who organized the <a href=""https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/eras/great-depression/brotherhood-of-sleeping-car-porters-win-over-pullman-company/"">Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters</a>, the first Black-run union. </p>

<p><a href=""https://www.npr.org/2009/05/08/103933268/pullman-porters-creating-a-black-middle-class"">Being a porter on a Pullman railroad car</a> was one of the few jobs open to Black men. But wages were low, travel was constant and trains’ white passengers patronized the porters by calling all of them “George,” after <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/people/george-m-pullman.htm"">George Pullman</a>, the mogul who owned the company.  </p>

<p>The company hired thugs to intimidate the porters, but Randolph and his top lieutenants persisted. They began their crusade in 1925 but didn’t get the company to sign a contract with the union until 1937, <a href=""http://www.pennfedbmwe.org/Docs/reference/RLA_Simplified.html"">thanks to a New Deal law</a> that gave railroad workers the right to unionize. Randolph became American’s leading civil rights organizer during the 1940s and 1950s and orchestrated the 1963 March on Washington.  </p>

<h2>5. 'North Country’ (2005)</h2>

<p>Charlize Theron portrays Josey Aimes, a desperate single mom who flees her abusive husband, returns to her hometown in northern Minnesota, moves in with her parents and takes a job at an iron mine. </p>

<p>There, she is constantly groped, insulted and bullied by the male workers. She complains to the company managers, who don’t take her seriously. The male-dominated union claims there’s nothing they can do. Aimes sues the company, which, after a dramatic courtroom scene, is forced to settle with her and other women.  </p>

<p>With stellar performances by Theron, Sissy Spacek, Frances McDormand and Woody Harrelson, “North Country” is based on <a href=""https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/real-women-north-country"">a groundbreaking lawsuit</a> brought by female miners at Minnesota’s Eveleth Mines in 1975 that helped make sexual harassment a violation of workers’ rights.</p>

    <p>The water off South Florida is <a href=""https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/data/vs/ts_figures/ts_multi_year/vs_ts_multiyr_florida_keys.png"">over 90 degrees Fahrenheit</a> (32 Celsius) in mid-July, and scientists are already seeing signs of coral bleaching off Central and South America. Particularly concerning is how early in the summer we are seeing these high ocean temperatures. If the <a href=""https://theconversation.com/ocean-heat-is-off-the-charts-heres-what-that-means-for-humans-and-ecosystems-around-the-world-207902"">extreme heat</a> persists, it could have dire consequences for coral reefs.</p>

<p>Just like humans, corals can handle some degree of stress, but the longer it lasts, the more harm it can do. Corals can’t move to cooler areas when water temperatures rise to dangerous levels. They are stuck in it. For those that are <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-022-02232-z"">particularly sensitive to temperature stress</a>, that can be devastating.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WS4sEzgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">I lead</a> the <a href=""https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/coral-reef-ecosystems/"">Coral Program</a> at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Lab in Miami, Florida. Healthy coral reef ecosystems are important for humans in numerous ways. Unfortunately, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/el-nino-is-coming-and-ocean-temps-are-already-at-record-highs-that-can-spell-disaster-for-fish-and-corals-202424"">marine heat waves are becoming more common</a> and more extreme, with potentially devastating consequences for reefs around the world that are already in a fragile state.</p>

<h2>Why coral reefs matter to everyone</h2>

<p>Coral reefs are hot spots of biodiversity. They are often referred to as the <a href=""https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/10index/background/biodiversity/biodiversity.html"">rainforests of the sea</a> because they are home to the highest concentrations of species in the ocean.</p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Healthy reefs are vibrant ecosystems that support fish and fisheries, which in turn <a href=""https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life/coral-reef-ecosystems#"">support economies and food for millions of people</a>. Additionally, they provide billions of dollars in economic activity every year through tourism, particularly in places like the Florida Keys, where people go to scuba dive, snorkel, fish and experience the natural beauty of coral reefs.</p>

<p>If that isn’t enough, <a href=""https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/science/role-reefs-coastal-protection"">reefs also protect shorelines</a>, beaches and billions of dollars in coastal infrastructure by buffering wave energy, particularly during storms and hurricanes. </p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">What goes into a coral reef?</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>But corals are quite <a href=""https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/climate-change-impacts/corals-and-climate"">sensitive to warming water</a>. They host a microscopic symbiotic <a href=""https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/tutorial_corals/coral02_zooxanthellae.html"">algae called zooxanthella</a> that photosynthesizes just like plants, providing food to the coral. When the surrounding waters get too warm for too long, the zooxanthellae leave the coral, and the coral can turn pale or white – a process known as bleaching.</p>

<p>If corals stay bleached, they can become energetically compromised and ultimately die.</p>

<p>When corals die or their growth slows, these beautiful, complex reef habitats start disappearing and can eventually erode to sand. A recent paper by <a href=""https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/tag/john-morris/"">John Morris</a>, a scientist in my lab in Florida, shows that around <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-23394-4"">70% of reefs are now net erosional in the Florida Keys</a>, meaning they are losing more habitat than they build.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these critical coral reef habitats are in decline around the world because of extreme bleaching events, disease and numerous other human-caused stressors. In the Florida Keys, coral cover has decline by about <a href=""https://www.climate.gov/news-features/features/mission-iconic-reefs-noaa-aims-restore-florida-keys-climate-resilient-corals"">90% over the past several decades</a>.</p>

<h2>Coral bleaching in 2023</h2>

<p>In the Port of Miami, where we have found <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33467-7"">particularly resilient coral communities</a>, a doctoral candidate in my lab, <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Allyson-Demerlis"">Allyson DeMerlis</a>, documented the first coral bleaching of her experimentally <a href=""https://reefresilience.org/management-strategies/restoration/coral-populations/coral-gardening/outplanting/"">outplanted corals</a> on July 11, 2023.</p>

<p>Other scientists we work with have reported coral bleaching off of Colombia, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Mexico in the eastern Pacific, as well as along the Caribbean coasts of Panama, Mexico and Belize.</p>

<p>We have yet to see widespread coral death associated with this particular marine heat wave, so it is possible the corals could recover if sea surface temperatures cool down soon. However, global sea surface <a href=""https://theconversation.com/ocean-heat-is-off-the-charts-heres-what-that-means-for-humans-and-ecosystems-around-the-world-207902"">temperatures are at record highs</a>, and large parts of the Atlantic and eastern Pacific are <a href=""https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/bleachingoutlook_cfs/index.php"">under bleaching alerts</a>. At this point, the evidence points to the potential for a very negative outcome.</p>

<p><a href=""https://theconversation.com/el-nino-is-back-thats-good-news-or-bad-news-depending-on-where-you-live-205974"">El Niño</a> is contributing to the problem this year, but the longer-term trends of rising ocean heat are <a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/"">driven by global warming</a> fueled by human activities.</p>

<p>To put that into context, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/srep16762"">a paper</a> by NOAA scientist <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rEv8BNoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">Derek Manzello</a> showed that in the Florida Keys, the number of days per year in which water temperatures were higher than 90 F (32 C) had increased by more than 2,500% in the two decades following the mid-1990s relative to the prior 20 years. That is a remarkable increase in the number of days that corals are experiencing particularly stressful warm water.</p>

<h2>What can we do to protect corals?</h2>

<p>First, we cannot give up on corals.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/people/alice-webb/"">Alice Webb</a>, a coral reef scientist working with our group, recently published <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26930-4"">a study</a> based on years of our research in the Florida Keys. She modeled reef habitat persistence under climate, restoration and adaptation scenarios and found that protecting reefs is going to take everything – active restoration of reefs, helping corals acclimate or adapt to changing temperatures, and, importantly, human curbing of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

<p>Major restoration efforts are underway in the Florida Keys as part of the NOAA-led <a href=""https://marinesanctuary.org/mission-iconic-reefs/"">Mission Iconic Reefs</a>. We are also assessing how different coral individuals perform under stress, hoping to identify those that are particularly stress-tolerant by combing through the massive amounts of <a href=""https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/umrsmas/bullmar/2023/00000099/00000002/art00006"">data from restoration projects and coral nurseries</a>.</p>

<p>We are also evaluating stress-hardening techniques. For example, in tide pools, corals are exposed to large swings in temperature over short periods, making them more resilient to subsequent thermal stress events. We are exploring whether it’s possible to replicate that natural process in the lab, before corals are planted onto reefs, to better <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1007/s00338-022-02232-z"">prepare them for stressful summers in the wild</a>.</p>

<p>Coral bleaching on a large scale has really been documented only since the early 1980s. When I talk to people who have been fishing and diving in the Florida Keys since before I was born, they have amazing stories of how vibrant the reefs used to be. They know firsthand how bad things have become because they have lived it.</p>

<p>There isn’t currently a single silver-bullet solution, but ignoring the harm being done is not an option. There is simply too much at stake.</p>

    <p>Psychedelics are all the rage. Well-known figures like quarterback <a href=""https://www.si.com/fannation/bringmethesports/nfl-news-and-rumors/aaron-rodgers-experience-with-psychedelics-made-me-better-player-lover"">Aaron Rodgers</a>, singer <a href=""https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/miley-cyrus-plastic-hearts-cover-story-1097528/"">Miley Cyrus</a> and boxer <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/mike-tyson-says-psychedelics-saved-his-life-now-he-hopes-they-can-change-world-2021-05-28/"">Mike Tyson</a> testify to their transformative impact. Less visible consumers are “microdosing” or signing up for <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/25/travel/psychedelic-retreat-ayahuasca.html"">retreats with shamanic guides</a> in this rapidly expanding subculture. In June 2023, the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies <a href=""https://psychedelicscience.org/"">held a conference in Denver</a> promoting research around psychedelics – part of a larger wave of enthusiasm for the benefits of substances like ecstasy, “<a href=""https://apnews.com/article/politics-utah-state-government-oregon-01b107bbfb416456539ee2f3371846cf"">magic” mushrooms</a> and LSD to treat PTSD, <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.02.018"">anxiety, depression</a>, addiction and other afflictions.</p>

<p>The current “<a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2021.2022254"">psychedelic renaissance</a>” is often talked about as revolutionary for the future of the human species. But as <a href=""http://religion.emory.edu/home/people/bios/laderman-gary-m..html"">a religion scholar</a> who studies the sacred uses of drugs, I think it would be valuable to look backward, not forward, to understand their significance. As usual, the past is present: Humans have incorporated drugs into their spiritual lives for millennia.</p>

<h2>Drugged animals?</h2>

<p>In fact, the consumption of psychoactive “drugs” is a feature of other species. <a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Intoxication/Ronald-K-Siegel/9781594770692"">The 1989 book</a> “Intoxication” by <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-ronald-siegel-dead-20190403-story.html"">Ronald Siegel</a>, a psychopharmacology researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, raised public and scientific awareness of the fact that animals will seek out intoxicating substances.</p>

<p>Signs of stoner life in the animal kingdom go way beyond <a href=""https://www.insider.com/guides/pets/what-does-catnip-do-to-cats"">cats and their catnip</a>. Birds and bees, elephants and bighorn sheep, and a range of other species in the wild return again and again – religiously, you might say – to <a href=""https://ucalgary.ca/news/elephants-get-drunk-because-they-cant-metabolize-alcohol-us"">substances that are dangerous but have appealing effects</a>. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>Among the more celebrated examples of this phenomenon are Siberian reindeer, which partake in the consumption of the fly agaric mushroom, a hallucogenic. Ethnobotanist <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giorgio-Samorini"">Giorgio Samorini</a> <a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Animals-and-Psychedelics/Giorgio-Samorini/9780892819867"">has described</a> how during the summer the reindeer seek out the mushroom, consume it and exhibit uncharacteristic behavior like twitching their heads, running aimlessly and making strange sounds.</p>

<p>Siegel argued that there is evidence humans and other organisms have <a href=""https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Intoxication/Ronald-K-Siegel/9781594770692"">a universal drive for intoxication</a> via psychoactive substances – a fourth basic drive along with those directed toward sex, food and water. In his view, drugs seem to ignite certain kinds of brain activities and interconnections that relate to <a href=""https://anthro.vancouver.wsu.edu/documents/586/Chapter_25.pdf"">biologically and evolutionarily advantageous behaviors</a>, like creativity and performance enhancement.</p>

<p>Biology professor <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=SSC0nPAAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate"">Oné R. Pagán</a> makes a similar argument in <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/689880/drunk-flies-and-stoned-dolphins-by-one-r-pagan/"">his 2021 book</a> “Drunk Flies and Stoned Dolphins.”</p>

<h2>Drugged ancestors?</h2>

<p>But there is much more to human drug use than animal instincts. In fact, <a href=""https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813056708"">the archaeological record</a> seems quite overwhelming in linking psychoactive substances in nature to ancient religious rituals. </p>

<p>One of the more recent archaeological discoveries about drug use in the Bronze Age, roughly 3,000 years ago, was found during excavations at a funeral site on the island of Minorca, off the coast of Spain. Researchers <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31064-2"">chemically analyzed human hair samples</a> that had been put in tubes made of wood or antler and placed near the dead. The results provided direct evidence of the consumption of psychoactive compounds produced by a variety of nightshade plants – mandrake, henbane and joint pine, in this case. Some of these compounds are stimulants, like ephedrine, and others can produce powerful hallucinations, delirium and out-of-body experiences.</p>

<p>Switching continents, a funerary space in western China also points to deep-rooted connections among drugs, altered states and ritual life. In this case, researchers <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw1391"">found cultivated cannabis plants</a> with fairly high concentrations of the psychoactive compound THC that were burned around 2,500 years ago in wooden containers, likely during ceremonies for the dead. While this is not direct evidence of drug consumption, the authors – who also found a harp at the site – suggest funerary rites may have included music and hallucinogenic smoke “to guide people into an altered state of mind.”</p>

<p>Throughout many eras, the <a href=""https://upf.com/book.asp?id=9780813056708"">prevalence of drug use for ritual purposes</a> certainly went beyond mortuary rites and has been tied to a variety of rites of passage, healing practices and collective ceremonies. </p>

<h2>Sacred drugs?</h2>

<p>What led our prehistoric ancestors to these powerful plants and fungi, and why did they use them over and over? </p>

<p>It would be very easy to project contemporary desires onto them: to battle depression or escape everyday life; to heal wounds, both physical and mental; to get high and just feel good; to self-medicate; to increase focus; to enhance performance; to sleep peacefully. The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the needs and desires of people living today have been shaped by modern societies. Evidence about why humans used drugs in prehistorical cultures around the globe points to some of the most elementary, yet critical, driving forces then and now: religious sensibilities, social bonding and group identity.</p>

<p>In the study of <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31064-2"">the funeral site in the western Mediterranean</a>, for example, the research team concluded that, given the potential toxicity of the alkaloids, someone with very expert knowledge about these compounds must have been involved in their production and consumption, likely a shaman. In research about prehistoric societies, the term “shaman” is a catch-all designation for individuals whose roles included religious leadership, healing and spirit communication, among others. In more contemporary lingo, they were key “influencers” in their communities’ religious lives.</p>

<p>The lead author of this study, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/profiles/elisa-guerra-doce-1433686/articles"">Elisa Guerra Doce</a> – a professor <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa-Guerra-Doce"">at the University of Valladolid</a> in Spain – has written extensively on drug plants and fermented beverages in ancient cultures. In one paper, an overview of <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1080/1751696X.2014.993244"">the archaeological evidence</a> of psychoactive substances in prehistoric societies, she underscores the pervasive connections between drugs and religion, reinforcing an increasingly common argument that “the deliberate induction of altered states of consciousness plays a key role in the belief systems of traditional societies all over the world.”</p>

<h2>Drugged today</h2>

<p>Drugs are ubiquitous in American society, even if we don’t always think of them as “drugs”: from drinking the morning cup of coffee to sipping a glass of wine in the evening; from swallowing prescription pills to ripping on a bong; from inhaling the nicotine in a vape to tripping at a psychedelically assisted therapy session.</p>

<p>What do the animalistic and ancient roots of humans’ interaction with drugs tell us about this contemporary landscape?</p>

<p>One take-away, I would argue, is that perhaps the desire to consume such substances and alter consciousness is a natural part of what it means to be human. Like us, people thousands of years ago experienced pain and pleasure, euphoria and death. Like us, they sought to understand reality and their place in it. The use of drugs in these experiences was not universal, but it was not uncommon either – especially in religious life.</p>

<p>Here and now, these types of uses for psychedelics have often been rebranded as clinical science, not spirituality. They are targeted to specific illnesses, <a href=""https://nyulangone.org/news/psychedelic-drug-therapy-may-help-treat-alcohol-addiction"">like addiction</a> <a href=""https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.25235"">or PTSD</a>, and discussed in terms of scientific successes, empirical data and patient satisfaction surveys. Yet even in the modern context, the deeper interconnections between drugs and religious life are hard to dismiss.</p>

  <div class=""grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos"" itemprop=""articleBody"">
    <p>On July 13, 2023, the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-nonprescription-daily-oral-contraceptive"">U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved</a> a drugmaker’s application for the first daily over-the-counter birth control pill for people seeking to prevent pregnancy.</p>

<p>The pill, called Opill – the brand name for the tablet formulation of norgestrel – is an oral contraceptive containing only progestin hormone, which helps prevent pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus, preventing ovulation or both. Opill was initially approved <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/opill-0075mg-oral-norgestrel-tablet-information"">by the FDA for prescription use in 1973</a>. Its approval for nonprescription use may spark other manufacturers of prescription-only birth control to follow. This highlights the importance of pharmacies as destinations for health care and pharmacists as facilitators of contraceptive care.</p>

<p>Opill is expected to be available through pharmacies, supermarkets, convenience stores and online retailers in early 2024. The FDA’s approval of an over-the-counter birth control pill can further expand options for people seeking hormonal contraception to all 50 states and U.S. territories. This expanded access could be a significant development in the post-Roe era as <a href=""https://theconversation.com/one-year-after-the-fall-of-roe-v-wade-abortion-care-has-become-a-patchwork-of-confusing-state-laws-that-deepen-existing-inequalities-207390"">individual states further restrict</a> women’s access to abortion.  </p>

<p>Prior to the FDA’s approval of this pill, many U.S. states have allowed pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception. The process begins <a href=""https://birthcontrolpharmacist.com/"">with a pharmacist consultation</a> to screen patients for eligibility, collect a medical history and measure blood pressure. If the patient qualifies, the pharmacist can provide a prescription to the patient; if not, the pharmacist refers the patient to a physician. </p><div class=""slot clear"" data-id=""17""><div class=""promo""><div class=""lazyload-wrapper ""><div class=""lazyload-placeholder""></div></div></div></div>

<p>We are a <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9Np7_DYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en"">pharmacist</a> and a <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=OIT2K2oAAAAJ"">public health expert</a>. We see the move toward over-the-counter birth control as an important step toward accessible and equitable reproductive health care for all Americans. Even though this product will be over-the-counter, pharmacists will play an indispensable role in that effort.</p>

          </figure>

<h2>Making birth control more accessible</h2>

<p><a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.07.003"">With more than 60,000 pharmacies nationwide</a>, pharmacists are the most accessible members of the health care workforce. Nearly 90% of Americans live within <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.07.003"">5 miles of a pharmacy</a>. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacies have provided testing, vaccination and treatment for millions of people in the U.S., <a href=""https://theconversation.com/how-the-test-to-treat-initiative-aims-to-get-ahead-of-the-next-wave-of-covid-19-179607"">proving their worth</a> in supporting and sustaining initiatives that are important to public health. </p>

<p>Traditionally, hormonal contraception – also known as birth control, or when taken orally, “the pill” – has only been accessible after a comprehensive medical evaluation by a physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner. </p>

<p>But in 2016, California and Oregon changed their legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe birth control. That quickly expanded to 20 states, plus Washington, D.C., that now <a href=""https://naspa.us/resource/contraceptives/"">allow pharmacists to prescribe</a> some form of birth control, whether it be the pill, patch, ring or shot.</p>

<p>However, the move toward over-the-counter birth control is important because it will lessen some of the known barriers to birth control, especially if the products are offered at an affordable price point. These barriers include the inability to pay for medical office visits required to obtain a prescription, lack of insurance to cover the cost of prescription birth control or lack of access to pharmacist-prescribed contraception.</p>

<p>Over-the-counter birth control can also reduce access barriers by preventing the need for a scheduled appointment with a primary care physician during work hours, the need for a pharmacist to be present to dispense prescription birth control or the need to travel long distances to access these professionals. </p>

<p>But it is important to note that over-the-counter access to hormonal birth control does not replace the importance of regular office visits or discussion about reproductive health with physicians.</p>

            <figcaption><span class=""caption"">The use of contraception was illegal in the U.S. from the late 1800s until the 1960s.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<h2>Addressing remaining barriers</h2>

<p>Even in states where pharmacists are currently allowed to prescribe birth control, over-the-counter hormonal birth control can make a difference.</p>

<p>For example, if state policies do not create payment pathways to reimburse pharmacists for their time to counsel and prescribe, pharmacists may choose not to participate in prescribing birth control. Additionally, pharmacist availability and time may be limited and more restricted than the hours a pharmacy is advertised as open to the public to sell over-the-counter birth control products.</p>

<p>Finally, there are notable cases of pharmacists who have denied patients access to emergency contraception, also known as the “morning-after pill,” and <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/06/25/623307762/walgreens-pharmacist-denies-drug-for-woman-with-unviable-pregnancy"">prescriptions for medication abortion</a> on the grounds of moral, ethical and religious beliefs. </p>

<p>For instance, in 2019, a pharmacist in Minnesota <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minnesota-pharmacist-trial-refusing-dispense-morning-pill-beliefs-rcna41030"">denied a patient emergency contraception</a>, citing personal beliefs. As a result, the patient drove 50 miles <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/08/03/minnesota-pharmacist-contraception-lawsuit/"">to gain access to the medication</a>. Ultimately, a jury found that the pharmacist did not discriminate against the woman by denying to fill her prescription.</p>

<p>This precedent suggests that pharmacists who object to the use of reproductive medications may further choose not to participate in prescribing hormonal contraception even when permitted to do so by state law. Individuals may also choose not to stock over-the-counter birth control when it becomes available.</p>

<h2>Pharmacist ‘conscience clauses’</h2>

<p>Notably, many states give pharmacists autonomy when dispensing medications. Currently, 13 states have laws or regulations known as “conscience clauses” that <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/can-pharmacist-legally-deny-patient-prescription-it-depends-n894871"">permit pharmacists to refuse to dispense a medication</a> when it conflicts with their religious or moral beliefs. </p>

<p>The American Pharmacists Association also recognizes an individual pharmacist’s right to conscientiously refuse to dispense a medication; however, the organization supports a system to <a href=""https://aphanet.pharmacist.com/policy-manual?key=Pharmacist+Conscience+Clause&amp;op=Search"">ensure patient access to medications</a> without compromising the pharmacist’s right of refusal. In other words, pharmacists are encouraged to “step aside” but should not “step in the way” of dispensing or selling medications that conflict with their personal beliefs. </p>

<p>Some states with conscience clauses legally require pharmacists to refer patients elsewhere when they decline to dispense a medication for ethical and/or moral beliefs. In addition, company policies may require pharmacists with objections to arrange for another pharmacist – who does not have objections – to provide the medication and care requested by the patient. However, some states do not require a system to ensure this patient access as the American Pharmacists Association suggests.</p>

<p>Pharmacist conscience clauses are unlikely to interfere with over-the-counter birth control availability at large pharmacy chains, supermarkets and mass merchandisers due to top-down decision-making structures of these organizations. However, national pharmacy chains have recently faced <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/business/walgreens-abortion-pill.html"">complicated legal and political situations</a> when it comes to offering prescription abortion pills in the post-Roe era.</p>

<p>Ongoing <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy"">legislation seeking to reduce abortion access</a> in the post-Roe era across the U.S. only increases the importance of patient access to contraception. Geographical spatial analyses have found that people of low socioeconomic classes and of color <a href=""https://read.dukeupress.edu/jhppl/article/46/2/277/166722/Affordable-but-Inaccessible-Contraception-Deserts"">disproportionately reside in contraception deserts</a>, which are areas with low access to family planning resources. These contraception deserts could be reduced or eliminated altogether now that retailers may sell over-the-counter hormonal birth control at an affordable price. </p>

<h2>Pharmacists’ role in providing contraceptive</h2>

<p>Although patients may seek and purchase over-the-counter hormonal birth control at locations other than community pharmacies, when patients come to a pharmacy, pharmacists can help them understand how to use the product correctly, safely and effectively prior to purchase. Pharmacists are trained as medication experts and acquire unique knowledge and skills of self-care products and nonprescription medications. When a pharmacist feels it is necessary, they can refer patients who do not qualify for over-the-counter birth control use back to their primary care providers for further evaluation and care.</p>

<p>In our view, pharmacists can positively contribute to the safe, effective and accessible use of contraception across the country.</p>

New Zealand shooter kills two ahead of Women's Soccer World Cup,"At least two people and an armed attacker were killed and five others wounded in a shooting in Auckland, hours ahead of the opening match of the Women's soccer World Cup.","AUCKLAND, July 20 (Reuters) - At least two people and an armed attacker were killed and five others wounded in a shooting in New Zealand's largest city of Auckland on Thursday, hours ahead of the opening match of the Women's soccer World Cup in the city.Prime Minister Chris Hipkins said the soccer tournament would proceed as planned, adding the shooting appeared to be the actions of an individual and that police were not seeking anyone else in relation to the incident.""There was no identified political or ideological motivation for the shooting and therefore no national security risk,"" Hipkins said during a televised media briefing.There would be no change to New Zealand's security threat level although there would be an increased police presence in the city, he said.Auckland has welcomed thousands of international players and tourists for the ninth Women's World Cup which is being co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.""Obviously we would prefer it not to have started in this way,"" Hipkins told journalists later in the day.""It will be acknowledged what happened today at the opening ceremony. And I will be going, it is safe to go and we continue to encourage the whole community to get behind this,"" he said.The gunman has not been formally identified but is believed to be a 24-year-old male who was employed at the construction site where the shooting occurred, Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said at a news conference.He was armed with a pump-action shot gun and moved through a building site shooting. After reaching the upper levels he contained himself within an elevator shaft and fired more shots before being found dead a short time later.An officer was injured in the shooting, as well as four members of the public.The gunman was the subject of a sentence of home detention but had an exemption to work at the site.""The individual is known for primarily family violence history. There is nothing to suggest that he has presented a higher-level risk than was indicated by that history,"" Coster said.Soccer teams from New Zealand, Norway, Italy, the U.S., Vietnam and Portugal were known to be in the city when the shooting occurred.""FIFA has been informed that this was an isolated incident that was not related to football operations and the opening match tonight at Eden Park will proceed as planned,"" FIFA said in a statement to Reuters.""The participating teams in close proximity to this incident are being supported in relation to any impact that may have taken place.""[1/8]Armed police stand guard near a construction site following a shooting in the central business district, in Auckland, New Zealand July 20. REUTERS/David RowlandIn the two opening World Cup matches on Thursday, Norway plays New Zealand in Auckland while Australia faces Ireland in Sydney.A moment of silence was observed before the match started in Auckland, and players wore black arm bands in honour of those who died in the shooting.The shooting took place near the Norwegian team hotel in downtown Auckland, and several players took to social media to report they were safe.""All seems calm, and we are preparing as normal for the match tonight,"" Norway captain Maren Mjelde told Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang during the police operation.Italy and the U.S. team's training was delayed as players could not get out of their hotel.Douglas Emhoff, the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris who is leading the presidential delegation to New Zealand for the opening ceremony of the World Cup, is safe, the U.S. embassy said.A U.S. Soccer spokesman said that the U.S. players were just getting up for breakfast inside the hotel when the incident occurred.""Our security sort of immediately liaised with the local authorities and Department of State. We determined immediately that everybody was safe and accounted for and from then on we just had to wait it out,"" Aaron Heifetz told reporters.U.S. forward Lynn Williams said the incident was something she and her compatriots had dealt with ""far too many times"" in the United States, where gun violence is common.""There was definitely a sense of, 'Let's come together.' We still have a job to do. But also recognising that there was lives lost and that is very real and very devastating,"" said Williams.Several streets in Auckland were cordoned off, all ferry services into the city were cancelled, and buses were asked to detour some areas of the city.Maurane Mifort-Paon, a 18-year-old tourist from France, said: ""At first I was kind of worried but when I saw how the police were everywhere, it was very reassuring.""Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown said the shooting was not in any way related to the World Cup.Gun violence is rare in New Zealand, which tightened its gun laws after a gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch in 2019 in the country's worst peace-time mass shooting.The government has banned all military style semi-automatics and other deadly guns.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Thomson ReutersPraveen leads a team of reporters covering companies and financial news in Australia and New Zealand.

<p>There was increased security at Eden Park stadium, where 42,137 — a record crowd for a soccer match in New Zealand — were on hand to cheer on the home team, co-hosts of the tournament with Australia. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was among those at the game. He went into the locker room after the game and thanked the team for an inspirational performance.</p><p>After an opening ceremony that honored New Zealand’s Indigenous heritage, there was a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting. Five people were wounded in the attack, including a police officer. </p><div class=""HtmlModule"">

<p>New Zealand’s Football Ferns had played in five previous World Cups, but hadn’t won a match.</p><p>“We really wanted to inspire young girls across the nation and I think we did that tonight. We showed that anything is possible,” said captain Ali Riley, who had happy tears in her eyes.</p><p>Norway couldn’t finish off its chances in the first half while the Ferns defended well. Ada Hegerberg’s attempt in the 37th minute was deftly defended by Rebekah Stott and the match was scoreless after the first half. </p>
<div class=""SovrnAd Advertisement sovrn-story-feed"" data-module=""""></div>
<p>The first woman to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or award, Hegerberg has 43 goals in 77 international appearances. Currently playing professionally for Lyon, she has scored a record 59 goals in the Champions League. But she couldn’t find the back of the net in Auckland. </p><p>Instead, Wilkinson scored in the opening moments of the second half. Jaqui Hand moved up the right side and placed a perfect cross at Wilkinson’s feet for the goal. While the home crowd wildly celebrated, Norway goalkeeper Aurora Mikalson stood with her hands on her hips. </p><p>Norway won the World Cup in 1995. At the last tournament in 2019, the team fell to England in the quarterfinals. At the Women’s Euro in 2022, England routed the Norwegians 8-0. In the run-up to this game, winger Caroline Graham Hansen called the World Cup a chance to “start fresh.”</p><p> “(It’s) the opening game, they are the hosts. We have talked about this. We knew they were going to go out there and be aggressive,” Norway midfielder Guro Reiten said. “We knew exactly how they wanted to play but still, we were so poor, especially in that first half. I’m very disappointed.” </p><p>Tuva Hansen nearly tied it for Norway in the 83rd but her shot caromed off the crossbar. The Ferns had a chance to double their lead in the 89th after video review awarded them a penalty, but Ria Percival’s attempt hit the post. </p><p>Stoppage time stretched for more than 10 minutes before the whistle blew and New Zealand’s bench rushed the field in celebration. Riley pounded her chest for the electrified fans. </p>
<div class=""SovrnAd Advertisement sovrn-story-feed"" data-module=""""></div>
<p>“It’s really hard to put into words, but absolutely surreal,” Ferns defender Katie Bowen said of the droughtbreaking victory. “I mean we made history tonight, but we can’t rest on that. Our goal is to get out of the group.”</p><p>Bowen said she was awakened by an early morning call from her brother, checking if she was OK after hearing about the Auckland shooting. </p><p>“I think everyone was just pretty taken aback, because this doesn’t really happen in New Zealand,” Bowen said. “But I think, especially on a game day, down to just each individual doing what they needed to do to process it and make sure they could focus on the game at the same time.” </p><p>New Zealand got the nod to stage the World Cup’s first game, although co-host Australia’s match against Ireland in Sydney started about an hour after fulltime in Auckland.</p><p>Considered the favorites in Group A, the Norwegians went into the game 5-1-1 all-time against New Zealand, with the only loss coming in a 2019 exhibition match. </p><div class=""Enhancement"" data-align-center="""">

<p>Norway coach Hege Riise said her players were not impacted by the shooting, despite the incident happened near their hotel. </p><p>“We knew it was under control, we felt safe. Some players slept through it,” Riise said. “We had an early morning meeting with everyone. It hasn’t had an effect on how we performed in the game.” </p><p>New Zealand had struggled in the run-up to the tournament on home soil, with just one win in its last 11 matches. </p><p>The two teams had met just once before at the World Cup: Norway beat the Ferns 4-0 in 1991. </p><h2>UP NEXT</h2><p>Group A play continues Friday with Switzerland playing the Philippines in Dunedin. New Zealand’s next match is Tuesday against the Philippines in Wellington, while Norway plays Switzerland in Hamilton. The top two teams in the group will advance to the knockout stage. </p>
